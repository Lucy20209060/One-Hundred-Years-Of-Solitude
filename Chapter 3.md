# Chapter 3

Pilar Ternera's son was brought to his grandparents' house two weeks after he was born. Úrsula admitted him grudgingly, conquered once more by the obstinacy of her husband, who could not tolerate the idea that an condition that the child should never know his true identity. <br />皮拉尔·特尔内拉的儿子在出生两星期以后被带到了祖父母家中。何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚不能容忍这种情况，除非不让这个孩子知道自己的真实身份，乌尔苏拉再次被丈夫的犟脾气打败，勉强接受了。

Although he was given the name José Arcadio, they ended up calling him simply Arcadio so as to avoid confudsion.<br />虽然他被命名为何塞·阿尔卡迪奥，但是最后他们干脆叫他阿尔卡蒂奥，以避免混淆。

At that time there was so much activity in the town and so much bustle in the house that the care of the children was relegated to a secondary level. They were put in the care of Visitación, a Guajiro Indian woman who had arrived in town with a brother in flight from a plague of insomnia that had been scourging their tribe for several years.<br />那个时候，镇上有很多活动，家里也甚是忙碌，照料孩子居于其次，托付给了维希塔西恩照料，她是一个瓜吉罗印第安女子，和兄弟逃离至此，因为失眠症折磨了他们的部落多年。

They were both so docile and willing to help that Úrsula took them on to help her with her household chores. That was how Arcadio and Amaranta came to speak the Guajiro language before Spanish, and they learned to drink lizard broth and eat spider eggs without Úrsula's knowing it, for she was too busy with a promising business in candy animals.<br />他们都很温顺，乐于助人，乌尔苏拉收留他们帮忙做家务。这就是为什么阿尔卡蒂奥和阿玛兰塔学会西班牙语之前先学会了说瓜吉罗语言，他们学会了喝蜥蜴汤，并且在乌尔苏拉不知情的情况下吃蜘蛛卵，而她正忙于大有前景的动物糖果生意。

Macondo had changed. The people who had come with Úrsula spread the news of the good quality of its soil and its privileged position with respect to the swamp, so that from the narrow village of past times it changed into an active town with stores and workshops and a permanent commercial route over which the first Arabs arrived with their baggy pants and rings in their ears, swapping glass beads for macaws.<br />马孔多变了，跟着乌尔苏拉过来的人四处宣传这里土地肥沃，地理位置比沼泽地优越，以至于这个往日狭小的村庄变成了一个熙熙攘攘的城镇，有了商店和工场，和一条永久的商业路线，第一批穿着布袋裤、戴着耳环的阿拉伯人通过这条路线来到这里，用玻璃珠交换金刚鹦鹉。

José Arcadio Buendía did not have a moment's rest. Fascinated by an immediate reality that came to be more fantastic that the vast universe of his imagination, he lost all interest in the alchemist's laboratory, put to rest the material that had become attenuated with months of manipulation, and went back to being the enterprising man of earlier days when he had decided upon the layout of the streets and the location of the new houses so that no one would enjoy privileges that everyone did not have.<br />何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚没有片刻休息，着迷于眼前的现实，想象力的广阔空间变得更加的奇妙，对炼金术士的实验室失去了所有的兴趣。他将操作了几个月效力逐渐降低的材料搁置一旁，变回了创业之初那个富有进取心的男人，那是他规划街道和房屋位置，人人平等，没有人能享受到其他人没有的特权。

He acquired such authority among the new arrivals that foundations were not laid or walls built without his being consulted, and it was decided that he should be the one in charge of the distribution of the land.<br />他在新来者人群中颇有权威，铺设地基、建造围墙都要找他征询意见，并且人们决定由他负责土地的分配。

When the acrobat gypsies returned, with their vagabond carnival transformed now into a gigantic organization of games of luck and chance that José Arcadio would be coming back with them.<br />吉普赛杂技演员回来时，他们的流浪者狂欢节现在变成了一个大型赌场，何塞·阿尔卡迪奥将会和他们一起回来。

But José Arcadio did not return, nor did they come with the snakeman, who, according to what úrsula thought, was the only one who could tell them about their son, so the gypsies were not allowed to camp in town or set foot in it in the future, for they were considered the bearers of concupiscence and perversion.<br />但是并没有回来，他们没有带着蛇人一起回来，根据乌尔苏拉的想法，蛇人是唯一知道她儿子下落的人。所以后来吉普赛人被禁止进入城镇，或在镇中安营扎寨，他们被认为是贪欲和变态的人。

José Arcadio Buendía, however, was explicit in maintaining that the old tribe of Melquíades, who had contributed so much to the growth of the village with his ageold wisdom and his fabulous inventions, would always find the gates open.But Melquíades' tribe, according to what the wanderers said, had been wiped off the face of the earth because they had gone beyond the limits of human knowledge.<br />然而，何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚明确地维护着梅尔基亚德斯的旧部落，他们以古老的智慧和优秀的发明，为村庄的发展做出了巨大的贡献，总能发现开放着的大门。但是根据流浪者所说，梅尔基亚德斯的部落已经从地球表面消失了，因为他们超越了人类知识的极限。

Emancipated for the moment at least from the torment of fantasy, José Arcadio Buendía in a short time set up a system of order and work which allowed for only one bit of license: the freeing of the birds, which, since the time of the founding, had made time merry with their flutes, and installing in their place musical clocks in every house.<br />至少从幻想的折磨中解脱出来的那一刻起，何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚在短时间内建立了一套秩序井然办事方法，只有一次被合法允许：放飞了自村庄建立以来的所有声音如长笛般的报时鸟，每家每户都安装了音乐时钟。

They were wondrous clocks made of carved wood, which the Arabs had traded for macaws and which José Arcadio Buendía had synchronized with such precision that every half hour the town grew merry with the progressive chords of the same song until it reached the climax of a noontime that was as exact and unanimous as a complete waltz.<br />这些神奇的时钟由木头雕刻而成，是从阿拉伯人那里用金刚鹦鹉交易而来。何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚校准精确，每半小时镇上便响起了同一首曲子的欢快和弦，一到中午便达到高潮，与完整的华尔兹一样精准一致。

It was also José Arcadio Buendía who decided during those years that they should plant almond trees instead of acacias on the streets, and who discovered, without ever revealing it, a way to make them live forever.<br />还有何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚在那些年决定在街道上应该种植杏仁树，而不是金合欢树，他发现了一种让树长生的方法，并且从未透露给别人。

Many years later, when Macondo was a field of wooden houses with zinc roofs, the broken and dusty almond trees still stood on the oldest streets, although no one knew who had planted them.<br />许多年以后，马孔多遍布镀锌屋顶的木屋，残败满是灰尘的杏仁树依旧矗立在古老的街道，尽管没人知道它们是由谁种植的。

While his father was putting the town in order and his mother was increasing their wealth with her marvelous business of candied little roosters and fish, which left the house twice a day strung along sticks of balsa wood, Aureliano spent interminable hours in the abandoned laboratory, learning the art of silverwork by his own experimentation.<br />父亲有序地整治城镇，母亲售卖小公鸡小鱼形状的蜜饯，通过这一非同一般的生意来提升财富，将蜜饯系在巴尔萨木棍上，每天两次出门兜售。奥雷里亚诺则经年累月地呆在废弃的实验室，通过自己的实验学习银制工艺。

He had shot up so fast that in a short time the clothing left behind by his brother no longer fit him and he began to wear his father's, but Visitación had to sew pleats in the shirt and darts in the pants, because Aureliano had not sequined the corpulence of the others.<br />他的身体发育快速，哥哥的衣服不再合身，便开始穿父亲的衣服，只是需要维希塔西恩缝紧衬衫的活褶和裤子的死褶，因为奥雷里亚诺没有其他人那么肥胖。

Adolescence had taken away the softness of his voice and had made silent and definitely solitary, but, on the other hand, it had restored the intense expression that he had had in his eyes when he was born. He concentrated so much on his experiments in silverwork that he scarcely left the laboratory to eat.<br />青春期带走了他柔和的嗓音，变得沉默寡言，吊形吊影，但是另一方面，他眼中恢复了出生时的紧张表情。他专心致志于银制品工艺的实验，几乎没有离开过实验室去吃饭。

Worried ever his inner withdrawal, José Arcadio Buendía gave him the keys to the house and a little money, thinking that perhaps he needed a woman. But Aureliano spent the money on muriatic acid to prepare some aqua regia and he beautified the keys by plating them with gold.<br />何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚担心他心里打退堂鼓，给了他房子的钥匙和一点钱，认为他可能需要一个女人。但是奥雷里亚诺用钱买了盐酸，研制王水，通过镀金美化钥匙。

His excesses were hardly comparable to those of Arcadio and Amaranta, who had already begun to get their second teeth and still went about all day clutching at the Indians' cloaks, stubborn in their decision not to speak Spanish but the Guajiro language.<br />他的过激行为几乎不能和阿尔卡蒂奥和阿玛兰塔相比，他们已经开始长第二颗牙齿，整天抓着印第安人的斗篷，顽固地不肯说西班牙语，只说瓜吉罗语。

"You shouldn't complain." Úrsula told her husband. "Children inherit their parents' madness." And as she was lamenting her misfortune, convinced that the wild behavior of her children was something as fearful as a pig's tail, Aureliano gave a look that wrapped her in an atmosphere of uncertainty.<br />“你不应该抱怨。”乌尔苏拉对丈夫说。“孩子继承了他们父母的疯狂。”当她哀叹自己的不幸，深信孩子们的狂野行为如同猪尾巴一样可怕时，奥雷里亚诺看了她一眼，让她感到一片迷茫。

"Somebody is coming," he told her.<br />有人要来了，奥雷里亚诺告诉她。

Úrsula, as she did whenever he made a prediction, tried to break it down with her housewifely logic. It was normal for someone to be coming. Dozens of strangers came through Macondo every day without arousing suspicion or secret ideas. Nevertheless, beyond all logic, Aureliano was sure of his prediction.<br />每次他预言时，乌尔苏拉总是试图用家庭主妇的逻辑打破它。有人来是正常的，每天都会有几十个陌生人经过马孔多，并没有引起怀疑和外人不得而知的的意见，尽管如此，除去所有的逻辑，奥雷里亚诺仍然确信自己的预言。

"I don't know who it will be," he insisted, "but whoever it is is already on the way."<br />“我不知道会是谁，”他坚持说，“不管是谁，都已经在路上了。”

That Sunday, in fact, Rebeca arrived. She was only eleven years old. She had made the difficult trip from Manaure some hide dealers who had taken on the task of delivering her along with a letter to José Arcadio Buendía, but they could not explain precisely who the person was who had asked the favor. <br />果然，星期天丽贝卡来了，她只有十一岁。跟随玛纳乌勒的皮草商贩长途跋涉而来，他们受人之托，将丽贝卡连同一封信交给了何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚，但是他们说不清楚托付之人是谁。

Entire baggage consisted of a small trunk, a little rocking chair with small hand-painted flowers, and a canvas sack which kept making a cloc-cloc-cloc sound, where she carried parents' bones.<br />丽贝卡的所有行李包括一个小行李箱，一个带有手绘花卉的小摇椅，和一个不停地发出咳咯-咳咯-咳咯声音的帆布袋，里面装有她父母的遗骨。

The letter addressed to José Arcadio Buendía was written is very warm terms by someone who still loved him very much in spite of time and distance, and who felt obliged by a basic humanitarian feeling to do the charitable thing and send that poor unsheltered orphan, who was a second cousin of úrsula's and consequently also a relative of José Arcadio Buendía, although farther removed, because she was the daughter of that unforgettable friend Nicanor Ulloa and his very worthy wife Rebeca Montiel, may God keep them in His holy kingdom, whose remains the girl was carrying so that they might be given Christian burial.<br />这封写给何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚的信出自一个温情之人，尽管时间和距离的阻隔，他仍然非常爱他。基本的人道主义让他必须做这件慈善之事——送来这个无家可归的可怜孤儿。他是乌尔苏拉的第二个表兄弟，所以也是何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚的亲戚，尽管关系疏远。因为她是念念不忘的朋友尼康诺·努尔和其非常贤惠的妻子的女儿，愿上帝在神圣的国度里保佑他们，女孩带来的遗骸能给予一个基督教的葬礼。

The names mentioned, as well as the signature on the letter, were perfectly legible, but neither José Arcadio, Buendía nor úrsula remembered having any relatives with those names, nor did they know anyone by the name of the sender of the letter, much less the remote village of Manaure.<br />信中提及的名字和签名都非常的清晰，但是何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚和乌尔苏拉都不记得有这些名字的亲戚，也不认识信的寄件人，更别说玛纳乌勒这个遥远的乡村。

It was impossible to obtain any further information from the girl. From the moment she arrived she had been sitting in the rocker, sucking her finger and observing everyone with her large, startled eyes without giving any sign of understanding what they were asking her.<br />从女孩身上也无法获得任何进一步的信息。从她来了以后就一直坐在摇椅上，吸吮着手指，用惊愕的大眼睛观察着每个人，对于人们的询问一副不解的样子。

She wore a diagonally striped dress that had been dyed black, worn by use, and a pair of scaly patent leather boots. Her hair was held behind her ears with bows of black ribbon.<br />她穿着被染黑了的斜条纹的连衣裙，已经破旧了，一双脱了皮的皮靴。她的头发用一个黑色的蝴蝶结扎在耳朵后面。

She wore a scapular with the images worn away by sweat, and on her right wrist the fang of a carnivorous animal mounted on a backing of copper as an amulet against the evil eye.<br />身上肩衣的图案已被磨损，右手腕上戴着一个铜币，上面装着一枚食肉动物的犬牙，当作抵抗“邪恶之眼”的护身符。

Her greenish skin, her stomach, round and tense as a drum, revealed poor health and hunger that were older than she was, but when they gave her something to eat she kept the plate on her knees without tasting anything.<br />皮肤浅绿，肚子像鼓一样又圆又紧，表明了长期处于不健康与饥饿中。但是当他们给她一些吃食时，她把盘子放在膝盖上，没有品尝任何东西。

They even began to think that she was a deafmute until the Indians asked her in their language if she wanted some water and she moved her eyes as if she recognized them and said yes with her head.<br />他们甚至开始认为她是一个聋哑人，直到印第安人用他们的语言询问她是否需要喝点水时，她的眼睛一动，仿佛认出了他们，随即点了点头。

They kept her, because there was nothing else they could do. They decided to call her Rebeca, which according to the letter was her mother's name, because Aureliano had the patience to read to her the names of all the saints and he did not get a reaction from any one of them.<br />他们留下了她，除此之外也无能为力。奥雷里亚诺耐心地读完所有圣徒的名字，她毫无反应。所有根据她母亲的名字，他们决定称她为“丽贝卡”。

Since there was no cemetery in Macondo at that time, for no one had died up till then, they kept the bag of bones to wait for a worthy place of burial, and for a long time it got in the way everywhere and would be found where least expected, always with its clucking of a broody hen.<br />在那之前马孔多还没有人去世，所以当时还没有墓地。他们保存好装有遗骨的袋子，等待一个好的埋葬之地。很长一段时间，它们到处碍事，总是出现在意想不到的地方，不时发出母鸡抱窝时一样的咯咯声。

A long time passed before Rebeca became incorporated into the life of the family. She would sit in her small rocker sucking her finger in the most remote corner of the house. Nothing attracted her attention except the music of the clocks, which she would look for every half hour with her frightened eyes as if she hoped to find it someplace in the air.<br />丽贝卡很长时间才融入到这个家庭的生活，她总是在家里最偏僻的角落，坐在自己的小摇椅上，吸吮着手指。没有什么能吸引她的注意，除了钟表的报时音乐，每隔半小时她都瞪着惊恐的眼睛四处寻找，仿佛想在空中某处位置找到音乐。

They could not get her to eat for several days. No one understood why she had not died of hunger until the Indians, who were aware of everything, for they went ceaselessly about the house on their stealthy feet, discovered that Rebeca only liked to eat the damp earth of the courtyard and the cake of whitewash that she picked of the walls with her nails.<br />他们发现她几天都没有吃饭，没人能想通她为什么没被饿死，直到印第安人秘密而无休止地在家里走来走去，观察着每个地方，发现丽贝卡只喜欢吃院子里潮湿的泥土和用指甲从墙上扣下来的石灰皮。

It was obvious that her parents, or whoever had raised her, had scolded her for that habit because she did it secretively and with a feeling of guilt, trying to put away supplies so that she could eat when no one was looking. From then on they put her under an implacable watch.<br />显然，她的父母或者其他抚养过她的人因这一恶习责骂过她，因为她秘密而为，心怀愧疚。藏起吃食，在无人注意的时候吃掉。从那以后，她被严格监视了。

They threw cow gall onto the courtyard and, rubbed hot chili on the walls, thinking they could defeat her pernicious vice with those methods, but she showed such signs of astuteness and ingenuity to find some earth that úrsula found herself forced to use more drastic methods. 

She put some orange juice and rhubarb into a pan that she left in the dew all night and she gave her the dose the following day on an empty stomach. Although no one had told her that it was the specific remedy for the vice of eating earth, she thought that any bitter substance in an empty stomach would have to make the liver react. 

Rebeca was so rebellious and strong in spite of her frailness that they had to tie her up like a calf to make her swallow the medicine, they could barely keep back her kicks or bear up under the strange hieroglyphics that she alternated with her bites and spitting, and that, according to what the scandalized Indians said, were the vilest obscenities that one could ever imagine in their language. 

When úrsula discovered that, she added whipping to the treatment. It was never established whether it was the rhubarb or the beatings that had effect, or both of them together, but the truth was that in a few weeks Rebeca began to show signs of recovery. She took part in the games of Arcadio and Amaranta, who treated her like an older sister, and she ate heartily, using the utensils properly. 

It was soon revealed that she spoke Spanish with as much fluency as the Indian language, that she had a remarkable ability for manual work, and that she could sing the waltz of the clocks with some very funny words that she herself had invented. It did not take long for them to consider her another member of the family. 

She was more affectionate to Úrsula than any of her own children had been, and she called Arcadio, Amaranta brother and sister, Aureliano uncle, and José Arcadio Buendía grandpa. So that she finally deserved, as much as the others, the name of Rebeca Buendía, the only one that she ever had and that she bore with dignity until her death.
