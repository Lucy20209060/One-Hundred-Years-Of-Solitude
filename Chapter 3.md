# Chapter 3

Pilar Ternera's son was brought to his grandparents' house two weeks after he was born. Úrsula admitted him grudgingly, conquered once more by the obstinacy of her husband, who could not tolerate the idea that an condition that the child should never know his true identity. <br />皮拉尔·特尔内拉的儿子在出生两星期以后被带到了祖父母家中。何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚不能容忍这种情况，除非不让这个孩子知道自己的真实身份，乌尔苏拉再次被丈夫的犟脾气打败，勉强接受了。

Although he was given the name José Arcadio, they ended up calling him simply Arcadio so as to avoid confudsion.<br />虽然他被命名为何塞·阿尔卡迪奥，但是最后他们干脆叫他阿尔卡蒂奥，以避免混淆。

At that time there was so much activity in the town and so much bustle in the house that the care of the children was relegated to a secondary level. They were put in the care of Visitación, a Guajiro Indian woman who had arrived in town with a brother in flight from a plague of insomnia that had been scourging their tribe for several years.<br />那个时候，镇上有很多活动，家里也甚是忙碌，照料孩子居于其次，托付给了维希塔西恩照料，她是一个瓜吉罗印第安女子，和兄弟逃离至此，因为失眠症折磨了他们的部落多年。

They were both so docile and willing to help that Úrsula took them on to help her with her household chores. That was how Arcadio and Amaranta came to speak the Guajiro language before Spanish, and they learned to drink lizard broth and eat spider eggs without Úrsula's knowing it, for she was too busy with a promising business in candy animals.<br />他们都很温顺，乐于助人，乌尔苏拉收留他们帮忙做家务。这就是为什么阿尔卡蒂奥和阿玛兰塔学会西班牙语之前先学会了说瓜吉罗语言，他们学会了喝蜥蜴汤，并且在乌尔苏拉不知情的情况下吃蜘蛛卵，而她正忙于大有前景的动物糖果生意。

Macondo had changed. The people who had come with Úrsula spread the news of the good quality of its soil and its privileged position with respect to the swamp, so that from the narrow village of past times it changed into an active town with stores and workshops and a permanent commercial route over which the first Arabs arrived with their baggy pants and rings in their ears, swapping glass beads for macaws.<br />马孔多变了，跟着乌尔苏拉过来的人四处宣传这里土地肥沃，地理位置比沼泽地优越，以至于这个往日狭小的村庄变成了一个熙熙攘攘的城镇，有了商店和工场，和一条永久的商业路线，第一批穿着布袋裤、戴着耳环的阿拉伯人通过这条路线来到这里，用玻璃珠交换金刚鹦鹉。

José Arcadio Buendía did not have a moment's rest. Fascinated by an immediate reality that came to be more fantastic that the vast universe of his imagination, he lost all interest in the alchemist's laboratory, put to rest the material that had become attenuated with months of manipulation, and went back to being the enterprising man of earlier days when he had decided upon the layout of the streets and the location of the new houses so that no one would enjoy privileges that everyone did not have.<br />何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚没有片刻休息，着迷于眼前的现实，想象力的广阔空间变得更加的奇妙，对炼金术士的实验室失去了所有的兴趣。他将操作了几个月效力逐渐降低的材料搁置一旁，变回了创业之初那个富有进取心的男人，那时他规划街道和房屋位置，人人平等，没有人能享受到其他人没有的特权。

He acquired such authority among the new arrivals that foundations were not laid or walls built without his being consulted, and it was decided that he should be the one in charge of the distribution of the land.<br />他在新来者人群中颇有权威，铺设地基、建造围墙都要找他征询意见，并且人们决定由他负责土地的分配。

When the acrobat gypsies returned, with their vagabond carnival transformed now into a gigantic organization of games of luck and chance that José Arcadio would be coming back with them.<br />吉普赛杂技演员回来时，他们的流浪者狂欢节现在变成了一个大型赌场，何塞·阿尔卡迪奥将会和他们一起回来。

But José Arcadio did not return, nor did they come with the snakeman, who, according to what úrsula thought, was the only one who could tell them about their son, so the gypsies were not allowed to camp in town or set foot in it in the future, for they were considered the bearers of concupiscence and perversion.<br />但是并没有回来，他们没有带着蛇人一起回来，根据乌尔苏拉的想法，蛇人是唯一知道她儿子下落的人。所以后来吉普赛人被禁止进入城镇，或在镇中安营扎寨，他们被认为是贪欲和变态的人。

José Arcadio Buendía, however, was explicit in maintaining that the old tribe of Melquíades, who had contributed so much to the growth of the village with his ageold wisdom and his fabulous inventions, would always find the gates open.But Melquíades' tribe, according to what the wanderers said, had been wiped off the face of the earth because they had gone beyond the limits of human knowledge.<br />然而，何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚明确地维护着梅尔基亚德斯的旧部落，他们以古老的智慧和优秀的发明，为村庄的发展做出了巨大的贡献，总能发现开放着的大门。但是根据流浪者所说，梅尔基亚德斯的部落已经从地球表面消失了，因为他们超越了人类知识的极限。

Emancipated for the moment at least from the torment of fantasy, José Arcadio Buendía in a short time set up a system of order and work which allowed for only one bit of license: the freeing of the birds, which, since the time of the founding, had made time merry with their flutes, and installing in their place musical clocks in every house.<br />至少从幻想的折磨中解脱出来的那一刻起，何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚在短时间内建立了一套秩序井然办事方法，只有一次被合法允许：放飞了自村庄建立以来的所有声音如长笛般的报时鸟，每家每户都安装了音乐时钟。

They were wondrous clocks made of carved wood, which the Arabs had traded for macaws and which José Arcadio Buendía had synchronized with such precision that every half hour the town grew merry with the progressive chords of the same song until it reached the climax of a noontime that was as exact and unanimous as a complete waltz.<br />这些神奇的时钟由木头雕刻而成，是从阿拉伯人那里用金刚鹦鹉交易而来。何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚校准精确，每半小时镇上便响起了同一首曲子的欢快和弦，一到中午便达到高潮，与完整的华尔兹一样精准一致。

It was also José Arcadio Buendía who decided during those years that they should plant almond trees instead of acacias on the streets, and who discovered, without ever revealing it, a way to make them live forever.<br />还有何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚在那些年决定在街道上应该种植杏仁树，而不是金合欢树，他发现了一种让树长生的方法，并且从未透露给别人。

Many years later, when Macondo was a field of wooden houses with zinc roofs, the broken and dusty almond trees still stood on the oldest streets, although no one knew who had planted them.<br />许多年以后，马孔多遍布镀锌屋顶的木屋，残败满是灰尘的杏仁树依旧矗立在古老的街道，尽管没人知道它们是由谁种植的。

While his father was putting the town in order and his mother was increasing their wealth with her marvelous business of candied little roosters and fish, which left the house twice a day strung along sticks of balsa wood, Aureliano spent interminable hours in the abandoned laboratory, learning the art of silverwork by his own experimentation.<br />父亲有序地整治城镇，母亲售卖小公鸡小鱼形状的蜜饯，通过这一非同一般的生意来提升财富，将蜜饯系在巴尔萨木棍上，每天两次出门兜售。奥雷里亚诺则经年累月地呆在废弃的实验室，通过自己的实验学习银制品工艺。

He had shot up so fast that in a short time the clothing left behind by his brother no longer fit him and he began to wear his father's, but Visitación had to sew pleats in the shirt and darts in the pants, because Aureliano had not sequined the corpulence of the others.<br />他的身体发育快速，哥哥的衣服不再合身，便开始穿父亲的衣服，只是需要维希塔西恩缝紧衬衫的活褶和裤子的死褶，因为奥雷里亚诺没有其他人那么肥胖。

Adolescence had taken away the softness of his voice and had made silent and definitely solitary, but, on the other hand, it had restored the intense expression that he had had in his eyes when he was born. He concentrated so much on his experiments in silverwork that he scarcely left the laboratory to eat.<br />青春期带走了他柔和的嗓音，变得沉默寡言，吊形吊影，但是另一方面，他眼中恢复了出生时的紧张表情。他专心致志于银制品工艺的实验，几乎没有离开过实验室去吃饭。

Worried ever his inner withdrawal, José Arcadio Buendía gave him the keys to the house and a little money, thinking that perhaps he needed a woman. But Aureliano spent the money on muriatic acid to prepare some aqua regia and he beautified the keys by plating them with gold.<br />何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚担心他心里打退堂鼓，给了他房子的钥匙和一点钱，认为他可能需要一个女人。但是奥雷里亚诺用钱买了盐酸，研制王水，通过镀金美化钥匙。

His excesses were hardly comparable to those of Arcadio and Amaranta, who had already begun to get their second teeth and still went about all day clutching at the Indians' cloaks, stubborn in their decision not to speak Spanish but the Guajiro language.<br />他的过激行为几乎不能和阿尔卡蒂奥和阿玛兰塔相比，他们已经开始长第二批牙齿（乳牙脱落开始于六岁左右），整天抓着印第安人的斗篷，顽固地不肯说西班牙语，只说瓜吉罗语。

"You shouldn't complain." Úrsula told her husband. "Children inherit their parents' madness." And as she was lamenting her misfortune, convinced that the wild behavior of her children was something as fearful as a pig's tail, Aureliano gave a look that wrapped her in an atmosphere of uncertainty.<br />“你不应该抱怨。”乌尔苏拉对丈夫说。“孩子继承了他们父母的疯狂。”当她哀叹自己的不幸，深信孩子们的狂野行为如同猪尾巴一样可怕时，奥雷里亚诺看了她一眼，让她感到一片迷茫。

"Somebody is coming," he told her.<br />有人要来了，奥雷里亚诺告诉她。

Úrsula, as she did whenever he made a prediction, tried to break it down with her housewifely logic. It was normal for someone to be coming. Dozens of strangers came through Macondo every day without arousing suspicion or secret ideas. Nevertheless, beyond all logic, Aureliano was sure of his prediction.<br />每次他预言时，乌尔苏拉总是试图用家庭主妇的逻辑打破它。有人来是正常的，每天都会有几十个陌生人经过马孔多，并没有引起怀疑和外人不得而知的的意见，尽管如此，除去所有的逻辑，奥雷里亚诺仍然确信自己的预言。

"I don't know who it will be," he insisted, "but whoever it is is already on the way."<br />“我不知道会是谁，”他坚持说，“不管是谁，都已经在路上了。”

That Sunday, in fact, Rebeca arrived. She was only eleven years old. She had made the difficult trip from Manaure some hide dealers who had taken on the task of delivering her along with a letter to José Arcadio Buendía, but they could not explain precisely who the person was who had asked the favor. <br />果然，星期天丽贝卡来了，她只有十一岁。跟随玛纳乌勒的皮草商贩长途跋涉而来，他们受人之托，将丽贝卡连同一封信交给了何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚，但是他们说不清楚托付之人是谁。

Entire baggage consisted of a small trunk, a little rocking chair with small hand-painted flowers, and a canvas sack which kept making a cloc-cloc-cloc sound, where she carried parents' bones.<br />丽贝卡的所有行李包括一个小行李箱，一个带有手绘花卉的小摇椅，和一个不停地发出咳咯-咳咯-咳咯声音的帆布袋，里面装有她父母的遗骨。

The letter addressed to José Arcadio Buendía was written is very warm terms by someone who still loved him very much in spite of time and distance, and who felt obliged by a basic humanitarian feeling to do the charitable thing and send that poor unsheltered orphan, who was a second cousin of úrsula's and consequently also a relative of José Arcadio Buendía, although farther removed, because she was the daughter of that unforgettable friend Nicanor Ulloa and his very worthy wife Rebeca Montiel, may God keep them in His holy kingdom, whose remains the girl was carrying so that they might be given Christian burial.<br />这封写给何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚的信出自一个温情之人，尽管时间和距离的阻隔，他仍然非常爱他。基本的人道主义让他必须做这件慈善之事——送来这个无家可归的可怜孤儿。他是乌尔苏拉的第二个表兄弟，所以也是何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚的亲戚，尽管关系疏远。因为她是念念不忘的朋友尼康诺·努尔和其非常贤惠的妻子的女儿，愿上帝在神圣的国度里保佑他们，女孩带来的遗骸能给予一个基督教的葬礼。

The names mentioned, as well as the signature on the letter, were perfectly legible, but neither José Arcadio, Buendía nor úrsula remembered having any relatives with those names, nor did they know anyone by the name of the sender of the letter, much less the remote village of Manaure.<br />信中提及的名字和签名都非常的清晰，但是何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚和乌尔苏拉都不记得有这些名字的亲戚，也不认识信的寄件人，更别说玛纳乌勒这个遥远的乡村。

It was impossible to obtain any further information from the girl. From the moment she arrived she had been sitting in the rocker, sucking her finger and observing everyone with her large, startled eyes without giving any sign of understanding what they were asking her.<br />从女孩身上也无法获得任何进一步的信息。从她来了以后就一直坐在摇椅上，吮吸着手指，用惊愕的大眼睛观察着每个人，对于人们的询问一副不解的样子。

She wore a diagonally striped dress that had been dyed black, worn by use, and a pair of scaly patent leather boots. Her hair was held behind her ears with bows of black ribbon.<br />她穿着被染黑了的斜条纹的连衣裙，已经破旧了，一双脱了皮的皮靴。她的头发用一个黑色的蝴蝶结扎在耳朵后面。

She wore a scapular with the images worn away by sweat, and on her right wrist the fang of a carnivorous animal mounted on a backing of copper as an amulet against the evil eye.<br />身上肩衣的图案已被磨损，右手腕上戴着一个铜币，上面装着一枚食肉动物的犬牙，当作抵抗“邪恶之眼”的护身符。

Her greenish skin, her stomach, round and tense as a drum, revealed poor health and hunger that were older than she was, but when they gave her something to eat she kept the plate on her knees without tasting anything.<br />皮肤浅绿，肚子像鼓一样又圆又紧，表明了长期处于不健康与饥饿中。但是当他们给她一些吃食时，她把盘子放在膝盖上，没有品尝任何东西。

They even began to think that she was a deafmute until the Indians asked her in their language if she wanted some water and she moved her eyes as if she recognized them and said yes with her head.<br />他们甚至开始认为她是一个聋哑人，直到印第安人用他们的语言询问她是否需要喝点水时，她的眼睛一动，仿佛认出了他们，随即点了点头。

They kept her, because there was nothing else they could do. They decided to call her Rebeca, which according to the letter was her mother's name, because Aureliano had the patience to read to her the names of all the saints and he did not get a reaction from any one of them.<br />他们留下了她，除此之外也无能为力。奥雷里亚诺耐心地读完所有圣徒的名字，她毫无反应。所以根据她母亲的名字，他们决定称她为“丽贝卡”。

Since there was no cemetery in Macondo at that time, for no one had died up till then, they kept the bag of bones to wait for a worthy place of burial, and for a long time it got in the way everywhere and would be found where least expected, always with its clucking of a broody hen.<br />在那之前马孔多还没有人去世，所以当时还没有墓地。他们保存好装有遗骨的袋子，等待一个好的埋葬之地。很长一段时间，它们到处碍事，总是出现在意想不到的地方，不时发出母鸡抱窝时一样的咯咯声。

A long time passed before Rebeca became incorporated into the life of the family. She would sit in her small rocker sucking her finger in the most remote corner of the house. Nothing attracted her attention except the music of the clocks, which she would look for every half hour with her frightened eyes as if she hoped to find it someplace in the air.<br />丽贝卡很长时间才融入到这个家庭的生活，她总是在家里最偏僻的角落，坐在自己的小摇椅上，吮吸着手指。没有什么能吸引她的注意，除了钟表的报时音乐，每隔半小时她都瞪着惊恐的眼睛四处寻找，仿佛想在空中某处位置找到音乐。

They could not get her to eat for several days. No one understood why she had not died of hunger until the Indians, who were aware of everything, for they went ceaselessly about the house on their stealthy feet, discovered that Rebeca only liked to eat the damp earth of the courtyard and the cake of whitewash that she picked of the walls with her nails.<br />他们发现她几天都没有吃饭，没人能想通她为什么没被饿死，直到印第安人秘密而无休止地在家里走来走去，观察着每个地方，发现丽贝卡只喜欢吃院子里潮湿的泥土和用指甲从墙上扣下来的石灰皮。

It was obvious that her parents, or whoever had raised her, had scolded her for that habit because she did it secretively and with a feeling of guilt, trying to put away supplies so that she could eat when no one was looking. From then on they put her under an implacable watch.<br />显然，她的父母或者其他抚养过她的人因这一恶习责骂过她，因为她秘密而为，心怀愧疚。藏起吃食，在无人注意的时候吃掉。从那以后，她被严格监视着。

They threw cow gall onto the courtyard and, rubbed hot chili on the walls, thinking they could defeat her pernicious vice with those methods, but she showed such signs of astuteness and ingenuity to find some earth that úrsula found herself forced to use more drastic methods. <br />他们把牛胆汁洒在庭院里，把辣椒涂抹在墙壁上，认为用这些方法可以遏制住她的恶习。然而她寻找泥土时所表现的敏锐和聪明才智，让乌尔苏拉不得不采用更加严厉的方法。

She put some orange juice and rhubarb into a pan that she left in the dew all night and she gave her the dose the following day on an empty stomach. Although no one had told her that it was the specific remedy for the vice of eating earth, she thought that any bitter substance in an empty stomach would have to make the liver react.<br />她把橙汁和大黄放入盘中，整晚暴露在露水中，第二天让其空腹喝下一剂。虽然没人告诉她这是吃土恶习的具体补救措施，但他认为空腹吃任何苦涩的东西，都会让肝脏有所反应。

Rebeca was so rebellious and strong in spite of her frailness that they had to tie her up like a calf to make her swallow the medicine, they could barely keep back her kicks or bear up under the strange hieroglyphics that she alternated with her bites and spitting, and that, according to what the scandalized Indians said, were the vilest obscenities that one could ever imagine in their language.<br />丽贝卡如此的叛逆和坚强，尽管身体羸弱，为了让她喝药，他们不得不像捆绑一头小牛一样，无法制止她乱踢乱踹，以及又是咬人又是啐唾沫，还喊着奇怪的文字。印第安人十分震惊，说这是他们语言中所能想象出来的最肮脏淫秽的话。

When Úrsula discovered that, she added whipping to the treatment. It was never established whether it was the rhubarb or the beatings that had effect, or both of them together, but the truth was that in a few weeks Rebeca began to show signs of recovery. She took part in the games of Arcadio and Amaranta, who treated her like an older sister, and she ate heartily, using the utensils properly.<br />乌尔苏拉知道后，将鞭打加入到了疗法中。她也不确定最后是大黄还是笞打，抑或二者共同作用下起了效果，事实是，几周内丽贝卡有了改善的迹象。她加入到了阿尔卡迪奥和阿玛兰塔的玩耍中，他们像对待姐姐一样对待她。她开始正确地使用餐具，尽情地吃饭。

It was soon revealed that she spoke Spanish with as much fluency as the Indian language, that she had a remarkable ability for manual work, and that she could sing the waltz of the clocks with some very funny words that she herself had invented. It did not take long for them to consider her another member of the family.<br />很快就发现，她说的西班牙语和印第安语一样流利，有着出色的手工能力。她能用自己编造的一些有趣的歌词演唱时钟的华尔兹舞曲。很快她被接纳了，成为了家庭的新成员。

She was more affectionate to Úrsula than any of her own children had been, and she called Arcadio, Amaranta brother and sister, Aureliano uncle, and José Arcadio Buendía grandpa. So that she finally deserved, as much as the others, the name of Rebeca Buendía, the only one that she ever had and that she let with dignity until her death.<br />她与乌尔苏拉非常亲密，甚至超过了其他孩子和乌尔苏拉的亲密程度。她称阿尔卡蒂奥和阿玛兰塔为弟弟妹妹，称奥雷里亚诺为叔叔，称何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚为爷爷。所以最后和其他人一样，她名字应该叫丽贝卡·布恩迪亚，这是她唯一拥有的名字，让她体面的活着直到终老。

One night about the time that Rebeca was cured of the vice of eating earth and was brought to sleep in the other children's room, the Indian woman, who slept them awoke by chance and heard a strange, intermittent sound in the corner. She got up in alarm, thinking that an animal had come into the room, and then she saw Rebeca in the rocker, sucking her finger and with her eyes lighted up in the darkness like those of a cat.<br />丽贝卡改掉吃土的恶习后，被带到其他孩子的房间睡觉。一天晚上，印第安女人偶然醒来，听到角落里传来一阵断断续续的奇怪声音。她焦急万分，以为有动物闯进了房间。然后看到丽贝卡坐在摇椅上，吮吸着手指，在黑暗中她的眼睛犹如猫眼一般发着光。

Terrified, exhausted by her fate, Visitación recognized in those eyes the symptoms of the sickness whose threat had obliged her and her brother to exile themselves forever from an ageold kingdom where they had been prince and princess. It was the insomnia plague.<br />命运中的恐惧、疲惫不堪，维希塔西恩从她的眼中人认出了这种疾病的症状，正是这种疾病迫使她和兄弟由一个古老王国的公主和王子变成了永远流亡在外的人。这就是失眠症。

Cataure, the Indian, was gone from the house by morning. His sister stayed because her fatalistic heart told her that the lethal sickness would follow her, no matter what, to the farthest corner of the earth. No one understood Visitación's alarm.<br />早上，印第安人卡塔乌雷离开了。他的姐姐留下来了，因为听天由命的内心告诉她：无论走到天涯海角，致命的疾病永远跟随着她。没有人理解维希塔西恩的忧虑。

"If we don't ever sleep again, so much the better," José Arcadio Buendía said in good humor. "That way we can get more out of life." But the Indian woman explained that the most fearsome part of the sickness of insomnia was not the impossibility of sleeping, for the body did not feel any fatigue at all, but its inexorable evolution toward a more critical manifestation: a loss of memory.<br />“如果我们不能睡觉，那就太好了，”何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚幽默地说，“那我们就获得更多的寿命了。”但是印第安女人解释说失眠症最可怕的不是因为身体根本感觉不到任何疲倦而睡不着，而是残酷地发展为一种更加严重的表现：失忆。

She meant that when the sick person became used to his state of vigil, the recollection of his childhood began to be erased from his memory, then the name and notion of things, and finally the identity of people and even the awareness of his own being, until he sank into a kind of idiocy that had no past.<br />她的意思是，当病人习惯了失眠状态，童年回忆便开始从记忆中消失，然后是事物的名称和概念，最后是人的身份，甚至是自己的意识，直到沦陷到没有过去的糊涂之中。

José Arcadio Buendía, dying with laughter, thought that it was just a question of one of the many illnesses invented by the Indians' superstitions. But Úrsula, just to be safe, took the precaution of isolating Rebeca from the other children.<br />何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚差点笑死，认为这只是众多疾病中印第安迷信编造出来的一个问题。但是乌尔苏拉为了安全起见，做了个预防措施，将丽贝卡和其他孩子隔离开来。

After severval weeks, when Visitación's terror seemed to have died down, José Arcadio Buendía found himself rolling over in bed, unable to fall asleep. Úrsula, who had also awakened, asked him what was wrong, and he answered: "I'm thinking about Prudencio Aguilar again." They did not sleep a minute, but the following day they felt so rested that they forget about the bad night.<br />几周以后，当维希塔西恩的恐惧似乎消失了时，何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚发现自己在床上翻来覆去，无法安睡。乌尔苏拉被吵醒了，问他出了什么问题，他回答说他又想起了普鲁登西奥·阿吉拉尔。他们一分钟也没睡，但是第二天他们感觉精力充沛，便忘了这个糟糕的夜晚。

Arcadio commented with surprise at lunchtime that he felt very well in spite of the fact that he had spent the whole night in the laboratory gilding a brooch that he planned to give to Úrsula for her birthday. They did not become alarmed until the third day, when no one felt sleepy at bedtime and they realized that they had gone more that fifty hours without sleeping.<br />午餐时间，阿尔卡蒂奥惊讶地评论说，尽管整夜呆在实验室做一个计划乌尔苏拉生日时送给她的胸针，但他感觉依然很好。直到第三天他们都没有感到惊慌，当他们躺在床上却毫无睡意时，于是意识到他们已经超过五十个小时没有睡觉了。

"The children are awake too," the Indian said with her fatalistic conviction. "Once it gets into a house no one can escape the plague."<br />“孩子们也醒着,”印第安人带着宿命论的信念说，“一旦进入房间，没人可以逃脱瘟疫。”

They had indeed contracted the illness of insomnia. Úrsula, who had learned from her mother the medicinal value plants, prepared and made them all drink a brew of monkshood, but they could not get to sleep and spent the whole day dreaming on their feet. In that state hallucinated lucidity, not only did they see the images of their own dreams, but some saw the images dreamed by others.<br />他们的确感染了失眠症。乌尔苏拉曾经从母亲那里学会了辨识具有药用价值的植物，让他们所有人喝下一剂川乌，但是仍然不能入睡，整天站着做梦。在幻觉清醒的状态下，不仅看到了自己梦中的景象，还能看到其他人梦中的景象。

It was as if the house were full of visitors. Sitting in her rocker in a corner of the kitchen, Rebeca dreamed that a man who looked very much like her, dressed in white linen and with his shirt collar closed by a gold button, was bringing her a bouquet of roses.<br />房间里好像有很多游客。丽贝卡坐在厨房角落里的摇椅上，梦境中看到一个长得非常像自己的男人，身穿白色亚麻布衣服，衬衫领子上扣着一个金色纽扣，给她带来一束玫瑰花。

He was accompanied by a woman delicate hands who took out one rose put it in the child's hair. Úrsula understood that the man and woman were Rebeca's parents, but even though she made a great effort to recognize them, she confirmed her certainty that she had never seen them.<br />一个女人挽着他，纤细的手中拿着一朵玫瑰，然后把花别在丽贝卡的头发上。乌尔苏拉明白这两个人是丽贝卡的父母，但她努力辨认，确信自己肯定从来没见过他们。

In the meantime, through an oversight that José Arcadio Buendía never forgave himself for, the candy animals made in the house were still being sold in the town. Children and adults sucked with delight on the delicious little green roosters of insomnia, the exquisite pink fish of insomnia, and the tender yellow ponies insomnia, so that dawn on Monday found the whole town awake.<br />与此同时，何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚永远不能原谅自己，由于他的一时疏忽，家里的动物糖果仍在镇上售卖。大人小孩高兴地吮吸着美味的感染了失眠症的小绿公鸡、精致的粉红色鱼儿、细嫩的黄色小马驹，以至于在星期一的早晨，发现整个镇子都清醒着。

No one was alarmed at first. On the contrary, they were happy at not sleeping because there was so much to do in Macondo in those days that there was barely enough time. They worked so hard that soon they had nothing else to do and they could be found at three o'clock in the morning with their arms crossed, counting the notes in the waltz of the clock.<br />起初没有人为此惊慌，相反，他们因为不用睡觉感到非常高兴，因为那时马孔多有太多的事情要做，几乎没有足够的时间。他们努力工作，很快便无事可做。凌晨三点，他们交叉着双手，数着时钟里华尔兹舞曲的音符。

Those who wanted to sleep, not from fatigue but because of the nostalgia for dreams, tried all kinds of methods of exhausting themselves. They would gather togetto converse endlessly, to tell over and over for hours on end the same jokes, to complicate to the limits of exasperation the story about the capon, which was an endless game in which the narrator asked if they wanted him to tell them the story about the capon, and when they answered yes, the narrator would say that he had not asked them to say yes, but whether they wanted him to tell them the story about the capon, and when they answered no, the narrator told them that he had not asked them to say no, but whether they wanted him to tell them the story about the capon, and when they remained silent the narrator told them that he had not asked them to remain silent but whether they wanted him to tell them the story about the capon, and no one could leave because the narrator would say that he had not asked them to leave but whether they wanted him to tell them the story about the capon, and so on and on in a vicious circle that lasted entire nights.<br />那些想睡觉的人，不是由于疲倦，而是因为怀念做梦，于是尝试各种方法让自己筋疲力尽。他们聚在一起谈论不休，一遍又一遍讲着同一个的笑话，一个复杂得让人恼怒至极的关于阉鸡的故事。这是一个永无止境的游戏，叙述者询问他们是否希望让他讲一个关于阉鸡的故事，当他们回答“是”的时候，叙述者则说他并没有要求他们回答“是”，而是询问他们是否希望让他讲一个关于阉鸡的故事；当他们回答“否”的时候，叙述者又说他并没有要求他们回答“否”，而是询问他们是否希望让他讲一个关于阉鸡的故事；当他们保持沉默，叙述者又说他没有要求他们保持沉默，而是询问他们是否希望让他讲一个关于阉鸡的故事；也没人离开，因为叙述者会说他没有要求他们离开，而是询问他们是否希望让他讲一个关于阉鸡的故事。依此类推，这种恶行循环持续了一整晚。

When José Arcadio Buendía realized that the plague had invaded the town, he gathered together the heads of families to explain to them what he knew about the sickness of insomnia, and they agreed on methods to prevent the scourge from spreading to other towns in the swamp.<br />当何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚意识到瘟疫已经侵袭整个镇子时，他召集家长，向他们讲解他对失眠症的了解。他们同意采取措施防止灾害蔓延至沼泽地的其他城镇。

That was why they took the bells off the goats, bells that the Arabs had swapped them for macaws, and put them at the entrance to town at the disposal of those who would not listen to the advice and entreaties of the sentinels and insisted on visiting the town.<br />他们取下山羊的铃铛，铃铛是从阿拉伯人那里用金刚鹦鹉换来的，把它们放在小镇的入口处，提供给那些不听从哨兵的劝告哀求，执意访问马孔多的人使用。

All strangers who passed through the streets of Macondo at that time had to ring their bells so that the sick people would know that they were healthy. They were not allowed to eat or drink anything during their stay, for there was no doubt but that the illness was transmitted by mouth, all food and drink had been contaminated by insomnia.<br />当时所有经过马孔多街道的外人必须摇响铃铛，以便让病人们知道他们是健康的。逗留期间他们禁止饮食，因为毫无疑问，病从口入，所有的食物饮品都被失眠症污染。

In that way they kept the plague restricted to the perimeter of the town. So effective was the quarantine that the day came when the emergency situation was accepted as a natural thing and life was organized in such a way that work picked up its rhythm again and no one worried any more about the useless habit of sleeping.<br />通过这种方式，他们将瘟疫限制在小镇周边范围内。隔离非常的奏效，这种紧急状态大家已习以为常，生活步入正轨，工作再次恢复节奏，没有人再担心失去无益的睡眠习惯。

It was Aureliano who conceived the formula that was to protect them against loss of memory for several months. He discovered it by chance. An expert insomniac, having been one of the first, he had learned the art of silverwork to perfection. One day he was looking for the small anvil that he used for laminating metals and he could not remember its name.<br />几个月来，奥雷里亚诺想出了保护大家防止失忆的主意，他是在偶然中发现的。作为第一批失眠症的资深患者，他完全掌握了银制品工艺。一天他正在寻找小号的铁砧（锻捶金属用的垫座），用于金属压层，但是忘了它的名称。

His father told him: "Stake." Aureliano wrote the name on a piece of paper that he pasted to the base of the small anvil: stake. In that way he was sure of not forgetting it in the future. It did not occur to him that this was the first manifestation of a loss of memory, because the object had a difficult name to remember.<br />父亲告诉他是“铁桩”，奥雷里亚诺把这个名称写在一张纸上，并把它贴在小号铁砧的底部。通过这种方式他确信以后再也不会忘记，他也没发觉这是失忆的第一个表现，因为这玩意儿确实有个难记的名称。

But a few days later be, discovered that he had trouble remembering almost every object in the laboratory. Then he marked them with their respective names so that all he had to do was read the inscription in order to identify them.<br />几天后，他发现自己很难记住实验室里每件东西的名称，于是他用它们各自的名称做好标记，以至于为了辨别它们不得不阅读纸上的文字。

When his father told him about his alarm at having forgotten even the most impressive happenings of his childhood, Aureliano explained his method to him, and José Arcadio Buendía put it into practice all through the house and later on imposed it on the whole village.<br />父亲把自己忧虑告诉了奥雷里亚诺，说他甚至忘记了童年最美好的事情，奥雷里亚诺向他说明了自己的方法。何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚首先在家里付诸行动，后来这种方法推行到了整个小镇。

With an inked brush he marked everything with its name: table, chair, clock, door, wall, bed, pan. He went to the corral and marked the animals and plants: cow, goat, pig, hen, cassava, caladium, banana. Little by little, studying the infinite possibilities of a loss of memory, he realized that the day might come when things would be recognized by their inscriptions but that no one would remember their use. Then he was more explicit.<br />他用签字笔标识每件物品的名字：桌子、椅子、时钟、门、墙、床、锅。他走进畜栏，标识动植物：奶牛、山羊、猪、母鸡、木薯、香蕉。逐渐地，在研究失忆的无限可能性过程中，他意识到即使通过文字认识东西，有朝一日也会忘记它们的用途。

The sign that he hung on the neck of the cow was an exemplary proof of the way in which the inhabitants of Macondo were prepared to fight against loss of memory: This is the cow. She must be milked every morning so that she will produce milk, and the milk must be boiled in order to be mixed with coffee to make coffee and milk.<br />他挂在牛脖子上的牌子就是马孔多居民做好准备对抗失忆的典型例子：这是奶牛。它必须每天早上挤奶，以便生产奶，牛奶必须煮沸才能和咖啡混合制成牛奶咖啡。

Thus they went on living in a reality that was slipping away, momentarily captured by words, but which would escape irremediably when they forgot the values the written letters.<br />就这样，他们继续生活在逐渐遗忘的现实中，但是当他们忘记书面文字的作用时，这种依赖文字才能保存的现实也将一去不返。

At the beginning of the road into the swamp they put up a sign that said MACONDO and another larger one on the main street that said GOD EXISTS. In all the houses keys to memorizing objects and feelings had been written.<br />在通往沼泽地的路口，他们竖起一个牌子，上面写着：马孔多；在主干街道上还有一个更大的牌子，上面写着：上帝存在。每家每户都写着记住物品和情感的要点。

But the system demanded so much vigilance and moral strength that many succumbed to the spell of an imaginary reality, one invented by themselves, which was less practical for them but more comforting. Pilar Ternera was the one who contributed most to popularize that mystification when she conceived the trick of reading the past in cards as she had read the future before. <br />但是这套系统需要高度的警觉和道德力量，以至于很多人抵挡不住虚拟现实的魅力，自我幻想，虽不切实际，但令人安慰。皮拉尔·特尔内拉是推广这种故弄玄虚贡献最大的人，她在阅读未来之前就曾构想过通过纸牌阅读过去的戏法。

By means of that recourse the insomniacs began to live in a world built on the uncertain alternatives of the cards, where a father was remembered faintly as the dark man who had arrived at the beginning of April and a mother was remembered only as the dark woman who wore a gold ring on her left hand, and where a birth date was reduced to the last Tuesday on which a lark sang in the laurel tree. <br />通过这种依赖的方式，失眠患者开始生活在由纸牌产生的飘忽不定可供选择的世界里。在那里，模糊地记得父亲皮肤黝黑，是四月初来到这的；母亲则只记得皮肤黝黑，左手戴着金戒指，出生日期简化为百灵鸟在月桂树上歌唱的最后一个星期二。

Defeated by those practices of consolation, José Arcadio Buendía then decided to build the memory machine that he had desired once in order to remember the marvelous inventions of the gypsies. The artifact was based on the possibility of reviewing every morning, from beginning to end, the totality of knowledge acquired during one's life.<br />何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚无奈于这种寻求慰藉的做法，他决定制造一种曾经想用来记录吉普赛人的神奇发明的的记忆机器。该装置的基础功能是：每天清晨将人一生中获得的知识从有到尾复习一遍。

He conceived of it as a spinning dictionary that a person placed on the axis could operate by means of a lever, so that in a very few hours there would pass before his eyes the notions most necessary for life. He had succeeded in writing almost fourteen thousand entries when along the road from the swamp a strange-looking old man with the sad sleepers' bell appeared, carrying a bulging suitcase tied with a rope and pulling a cart covered with black cloth. He went straight to the house of José Arcadio Buendía.<br />他设想它是一个快速旋转的辞典，人坐在枢纽上，操作控制杆，短短几个小时内生活中必要的概念从眼前经过。当他成功地写下将近一万四千条记录时，悲凉的睡眠者铃声响起，一个样子奇怪的老人沿着道路从沼泽地走来，载着一个扎满绳子鼓鼓囊囊的箱子，拉着一个黑布覆盖着的推车，径直来到何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚的家中。

Visitación did not recognize him when she opened the door she thought he had come with the idea of selling something, unaware that nothing could be sold in a town that was sinking irrevocably into the quick-sand of forgetfulness.<br />维希塔西恩打开门的时候并没有认出他，以为他来这售卖东西，却没有察觉到这个深陷失忆流沙中的小镇无物可卖。

He was a decrepit man. Although his voice was also broken by uncertainty and his hands seemed to doubt the existence of things, it was evident that he came from the world where men could still sleep and remember.<br />老人年迈体弱，尽管嗓音断断续续，双手摸摸索索，显然他来自一个人们依旧可以睡觉和记忆的世界。

José Arcadio Buendía found him sitting in the living room fanning himself with a patched black hat as he read with compassionate attention the signs pasted to the walls. He greeted him with a broad show of affection, afraid that he had known him at another time and that he did not remember him now.<br />何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚发现他坐在客厅，用打着补丁的黑色帽子扇着风，充满同情地看着贴在墙上的字条。何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚非常热情地迎接了他，害怕自己以前认识他，只是如今已不记得他了。

But the visitor was aware his falseness, He felt himself forgotten, not with the irremediable forgetfulness of the heart, but with a different kind of forgetfulness, which was more cruel and irrevocable and which he knew very well because it was the forgetfulness of death.<br />来访者察觉到了他的伪装，并感觉到了自己已被遗忘。他非常清楚这不是内心暂时的遗忘，而是一种不同的，更加残酷和无法挽回的遗忘，因为这是对死亡的遗忘。

Then he understood. He opened the suitcase crammed with indecipherable objects and from among then he took out a little case with many flasks. He gave José Arcadio Buendía a drink of a gentle color and the light went on in his memory.<br />于是便明白了，他打开装满不知道什么东西的手提箱，从其中拿出装着许多瓶子的小盒子。他把一瓶颜色柔和的液体给了何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚，喝完马上便恍然大悟。

His eyes became moist from weeping even before he noticed himself in an absurd living room where objects were labeled and before he was ashamed of the solemn nonsense written on the walls, and even before he recognized the newcomer with a dazzling glow of joy. It was Melquíades.<br />他眼睛湿润了，看到自己身处物品贴满标签的荒唐的客厅，羞愧于写在墙上的庄重的废话。然后他兴高采烈地认出了新来者，他是梅尔基亚德斯。

While Macondo was celebrating the recovery of its memory, José Arcadio Buendía and Melquíades dusted off their old friendship. The gypsy was inclined to stay in the town. He really had been through death, but he had returned because he could not bear the solitude.<br />全镇都在庆祝记忆的恢复，何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚和梅尔基亚德斯也重拾了旧日的友谊。吉普赛人想留在小镇上，他们经历了死亡，再也无法忍受孤独，所以他们回来了。

Repudiated by his tribe, having lost all of his supernatural faculties because of his faithfulness to life, he decided to take refuge in that corner of the world which had still not been discovered by death, dedicated to the operation a daguerreotype laboratory. José Arcadio Buendía had never heard of that invention.<br />被自己的部落拒绝在外，由于忠于生活，失去了超自然之力。他决定在世界那个尚未被死亡发现的角落避难，操办一间银版摄影术实验室，何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚从未听说过这项发明。

But when he saw himself and his whole family fastened onto a sheet of iridescent metal for an eternity, he was mute with stupefaction. That was the date of the oxidized daguerreotype in which José Arcadio Buendía appeared with his bristly and graying hair, his card board collar attached to his shirt by a copper button, and an expression of startled solemnity, whom úrsula described, dying with laughter, as a "frightened general."<br />但是当看到自己和家人永恒地固定在一片五彩斑斓的金属板上时，他讶异得哑口无言。从那时起，出现在氧化印版照片上的何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚总是粗糙灰色的头发，浆硬的衬衫衣领扣着一个铜质纽扣，一副严肃惊讶的表情。乌尔苏拉笑得死去活来，形容他像一个“受惊的将军”。

José Arcadio Buendía was, in fact, frightened on that clear December morning when the daguerreotype was made, for he was thinking that people were slowly wearing away while his image would endure an a metallic plaque. Through a curious reversal of custom, it was Úrsula who got that idea out of his head, as it was also she who forgot her ancient bitterness decided that Melquíades would stay on in the house, although she never permitted them to make a daguerreotype of her because (according to her very words) she did not want to survive as a laughingstock for her grandchildren.<br />实际上，何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚在十二月的一个晴朗清晨制作银版照片的过程中受到了惊吓。他认为如果把形象留存在金属牌上的话，人将会慢慢衰竭。一反常态，乌尔苏拉打消了他脑中的这种想法，她忘掉过去的痛苦，决定让梅尔基亚德斯留下来，虽然她从未允许他们为她拍照，因为（根据她的话）她不想给孙子孙女留下笑柄。

That morning she dressed the children in their best clothes, powdered their faces, and gave a spoonful of marrow syrup to each one so that they would all remain absolutely motionless during the nearly two minutes in front of Melquíades fantastic camera. In the family daguerreotype, the only one that ever existed, Aureliano appeared dressed in black velvet between Amaranta and Rebeca.<br />早上，她给孩子们穿上了他们最好的衣服，脸上涂脂抹粉，并且给他们每人吃了一勺糖浆精华露，保证他们在梅尔基亚德斯硕大的相机前可以一动不动的呆上将近两分钟。这张家庭银版照片，是唯一留存下来的，奥雷里亚诺穿着黑色天鹅绒礼服，站在阿玛兰塔和丽贝卡之间。

He had the same languor and the same clairvoyant look that he would have years later as he faced the firing squad. But he still had not sensed the premonition of his fate. He was an expert silversmith, praised all over the swampland for the delicacy of his work.<br />几年以后，他以同样倦怠和未卜先知的模样面对行刑队。但他仍未察觉到命运的征兆，他只是一个银匠行家，因精巧的活计而在整个沼泽区大受称赞。

In the workshop, which he shared with Melquíades' mad laboratory, he could barely be heard breathing. He seemed to be taking refuge in some other time, while his father and the gypsy with shouts interpreted the predictions of Nostradamus amidst a noise flasks and trays and the disaster of spilled acids and silver bromide that was lost in the twists and turns it gave at every instant.<br />在工作间，即与梅尔基亚德斯共享的疯狂实验室，甚至听不到他的呼吸声。他的父亲和吉普赛人大声争论诺查丹玛斯的预言，烧瓶和托盘撞击作响，酸液灾难性的溅洒出来，溴化银顷刻间被打翻，四处流淌，而他仿佛在另一个时空避难。

That dedication to his work, the good judgment with which he directed his attention, had allowed Aureliano to earn in a short time more money than Úrsula had with her delicious candy fauna, but everybody thought it strange that he was now a full grown man and had not known a woman. It was true that he had never had one.<br />他热爱工作，全神贯注让他拥有良好的判断力，这让奥雷里亚诺在短时间内比乌尔苏拉美味的动物糖果挣得钱都多。但所有人都很奇怪，他已是一个成年人，却从未结识过一个女人，事实上他确实没有。

Several months later saw the return of Francisco the Man, as ancient vagabond who was almost two hundred years old and who frequently passed through Macondo distributing songs that he composed himself. In them Francisco the Man told in great detail the things that had happened in the towns along his route, from Manaure to the edge of the swamp, so that if anyone had a message to send or an event to make public, he would pay him two cents to include it in his repertory.<br />几个月后，看见好汉弗朗西斯科回来了，作为一个将近两百岁的高龄流浪者，过去经常来到马孔多吟唱自己创作的歌谣，讲述自己在旅途中的各地见闻，从马孔多一直到沼泽地边缘。所以如果有人想发送或公开一个信息，就会付给他两分钱，将其编入歌谣中。

That was how Úrsula learned of the death of her mother, as a simple consequence of listening to the songs in the hope that they would say something about her son José Arcadio. Francisco the Man, called that because he had once defeated the devil in a duel of improvisation, and whose real name no one knew, disappeared from Macondo during the insomnia plague and one night he appeared suddenly in Catarino's store.<br />乌尔苏拉听这些歌谣，一个有价值的信息是知道了自己的母亲去世了，她本希望能听到一些关于儿子何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥的下落。之所以称之为好汉弗朗西斯科，是因为曾经在一场即兴的决斗中他击败了魔鬼，其真名无人知晓。他消失于马孔多失眠症肆虐期间，一天晚上他又突然出现在卡塔林诺的店里。

The whole town went to listen to him to find out what had happened in the world. On that occasion there arrived with him a woman who was so fat that four Indians had to carry her in a rocking chair, and an adolescent mulatto girl with a forlorn look who protected her from the sun with an umbrella.<br />全镇的人都跑去听他唱歌，了解世界上发生的事情。在那里，跟随他一起来的还有一个非常肥胖的女人，需要四个印第安人用摇椅抬着；还有一个黑白混血的少女，孤苦伶仃的表情，打着伞遮挡着阳光。

Aureliano went to Catarino's store that night. He found Francisco the Man, like a monolithic chameleon, sitting in the midst of a circle bystanders. He was singing the news with his old, out-of-tune voice, accompanying himself with the same archaic accordion that Sir Walter Raleigh had given him in the Guianas and keeping time with his great walking feet that were cracked from saltpeter.<br />这晚奥雷里亚诺去了卡塔林诺的店里，他看见好汉弗朗西斯科像一只巨大的变色龙，团坐在观众围绕的圈子中间。他用苍老走调的嗓音唱着新闻，伴奏拉的是沃尔特·罗利爵士在圭亚那（南美洲北部）赠与他的古老手风琴，他那双因踩过硝石而皲裂的大脚还打着拍子。

In front of a door at the rear through which men were going and coming, the matron of the rocking chair was sitting and fanning herself in silence. Catarino, with a felt rose behind his ear, was selling the gathering mugs of fermented cane juice, and he took advantage of the occasion to go over to the men and put his hand on them where he should not have.<br />后面有扇门，时有男人进出，门前鸨母坐在摇椅上静静地扇着扇子。卡塔林诺的耳朵后面别着一支毡制玫瑰，正在出售杯装的酿制甘蔗汁。并借着这个机会靠近那些男人，将手放到不该放的地方。

Toward midnight the heat was unbearable. Aureliano listened to the news to the end without hearing anything that was of interest to his family. He was getting ready to go home when the matron signaled him with her hand.<br />到了午夜，暑热难耐，直到结束也没有听到任何与家人有关的信息。他正准备回家时，鸨母招手向其示意。

"You go in too," she told him. "It only costs twenty cents."<br />“你也进去吧，”她对他说。“只需要二十分钱。”

Aureliano threw a coin into the hopper that the matron had in her lap and went into the room without knowing why. The adolescent mulatto girl, small bitch's teats, was naked on the bed. Before Aureliano sixty-three men had passed through the room that night. From being used so much, kneaded with sweat and sighs, the air in the room had begun to turn to mud.<br />奥雷里亚诺将一枚硬币扔进鸨母膝盖上的漏斗中，不知为何便走进了房间。这个黑白混血的少女，袒露着小母狗般的乳头，浑身赤裸躺在床上。当晚，在奥雷里亚诺来之前，已有六十三个男人来过这个房间。房间里糅杂着汗水与叹息，空气也变得污浊不堪。

The girl took off the soaked sheet and asked Aureliano to hold it by one side. It was as heavy as a piece of canvas. They squeezed it, twisting it at the ends until it regained its natural weight. They turned over the mat and the sweat came out of the other side. Aureliano was anxious for that operation never to end.<br />女孩揭下浸湿的床单，让奥雷里亚诺抓着另外一头。床单重的像一片帆布。他们在两头拧，直到恢复到正常的重量。他们把床垫翻了过来，汗水又从另一边流出来，奥雷里亚诺担心这将没完没了。

He knew the theoretical mechanics of love, but he could not stay on his feet because of the weakness of his knees, and although he had goose pimples on his burning skin he could not resist the urgent need to expel the weight of his bowels. When the girl finished fixing up the bed and told him to get undressed, he gave her a confused explanation: "They made me come in. They told me to throw twenty cents into the hopper and hurry up."<br />他了解性爱的理论技巧，但是由于膝盖疲软，脚都站不起来。尽管滚烫的皮肤上长满鸡皮疙瘩，仍忍不住迫切排除体内重负。当女孩整理完床铺并告诉他脱掉衣服时，他困惑地解释说：“他们让我进来的，他们告诉我赶紧往漏斗里扔二十分钱。”

The girl understood his confusion. "If you throw in twenty cents more when you go out, you can stay a little longer," she said softly. Aureliano got undressed, tormented by shame, unable to get rid the idea that-his nakedness could not stand comparison with that of his brother. In spite of the girl's efforts he felt more and more indifferent and terribly alone.<br />女孩理解他的困惑，“如果你出去时多扔二十分钱，就可以再待一会儿，”她温柔地说道。奥雷里亚诺脱了衣服，羞愧至极，总认为自己的裸体无法和哥哥的相比。尽管女孩一直努力，他反而越感觉冷漠和异常孤独。

"I'll throw in other twenty cents," he said with a desolate voice. The girl thanked him in silence. Her back was raw. Her skin was stuck to her ribs and her breathing was forced because of an immeasurable exhaustion.<br />“我会再投二十分钱的，”他用冷淡的声音说道。女孩沉默着向其致谢。她背部都已擦伤，瘦的皮包骨。由于无尽的虚脱，她的呼吸急促。

Two years before, far away from there, she had fallen asleep without putting out the candle and had awakened surrounded by flames. The house where she lived with the grand-mother who had raised her was reduced to ashes. Since then her grandmother carried her from town to town, putting her to bed for twenty cents in order to make up the value of the burned house. According to the girl's calculations, she still had ten years of seventy men per night, because she also had to pay the expenses of the trip and food for both of them as well as the pay of the Indians who carried the rocking chair.<br />两年前，在离这很远的地方，她睡觉时没有熄灭蜡烛，醒来时周围已火焰重重。她与养育她的祖母一起居住的房子化为灰烬。从此祖母带着她从一个地方流浪到另一个地方，为了二十分钱让她和男人上床，以弥补烧毁的房屋。根据女孩的计算，如果每晚接待七十个男人，仍需要十年时间，因为她还需要支付他们自己旅程和食物的开支，以及支付抬摇椅的印第安人的工资。

When the matron knocked on the door the second time, Aureliano left the room without having done anything, troubled by a desire to weep. That night he could not sleep, thinking about the girl, with a mixture of desire and pity. He felt an irresistible need to love her and protect her.<br />当鸨母第二次来敲门的时候，奥雷里亚诺没有做什么便离开了房间，却因为想哭而烦恼。晚上他无法入睡，想着那个女孩，充满了欲望和怜悯，忍不住想要爱她、保护她。

At dawn, worn out by insomnia and fever, he made the calm decision to marry her in order to free her from the despotism of her grandmother and to enjoy all the nights of satisfaction that she would give the seventy men. But at ten o'clock in the morning, when he reached Catarino's store, the girl had left town.<br />黎明时分，他因失眠和发烧而疲惫不堪。他做了一个冷静的决定，和她结婚，使其从祖母的专制中获得自由，并且可以享受她给七十个男人的整夜的满足感。但是早上十点，当他来到卡塔林诺的店里，女孩已离开小镇。

Time mitigated his mad proposal, but it aggravated his feelings of frustration. He took refuge in work. He resigned himself to being a womanless man for all his life in order to hide the shame of his uselessness. In the meantime, Melquíades had printed on his plates everything that was printable in Macondo, and he left the daguerreotype laboratory to the fantasies of José Arcadio Buendía who had resolved to use it to obtain scientific proof of the existence of God.<br />时间逐渐打消了他的疯狂想法，但这加剧了他的挫败感。他在工作中寻求慰藉。为了掩饰自己的无能所带来的羞耻，他接受了自己一辈子孑然一身的命运。与此同时，梅尔基亚德斯将马孔多一切可印刷的东西印刷到了金属板上，于是便把印板照片实验室送给了空想连篇的何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚，而他决定用此获取上帝存在的科学证据。

Through a complicated process of superimposed exposures taken in different parts of the house, he was sure that sooner or later he would get a daguerreotype of God, if He existed, or put an end once and for all to the supposition of His existence.<br />通过在房子的不同部分采取的复杂的叠加曝光过程，他确信，如果上帝存在，不久就能得到他的银版照片，或许能彻底结束一切上帝存在的臆测。

Melquíades got deeper into his interpretations of Nostradamus. He would stay up until very late, suffocating in his faded velvet vest, scribbling with his tiny sparrow hands, whose rings had lost the glow of former times. One night he thought he had found a prediction of the future of Macondo. It was to be a luminous city with great glass houses where there was no trace remaining of the race of the Buendía.<br />梅尔基亚德斯深入研究破解诺查丹玛斯。他一直熬夜到很晚，蜷缩在褪色的丝绒背心中艰难地呼吸，用他那麻雀爪般的手乱涂乱画，手指上的戒指失去了昔日的光芒。一天晚上，他认为自己找到了对马孔多未来的预言。它将是一个明亮的城市，以及宏伟的玻璃房屋，但是没有布恩迪亚家族存在的痕迹。

"It's a mistake," José Arcadio Buendía thundered. "They won't be houses of glass but of ice, as I dreamed, and there will always be a Buendía, per omnia secula seculorum." Úrsula fought to preserve common sense in that extravagant house, having broadened her business of little candy animals an oven that went all night turning out baskets and more baskets of bread and a prodigious variety puddings, meringues, and cookies, which disappeared in a few hours on the roads winding through the swamp.<br />“简直荒谬，”何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚咆哮道。“不是玻璃屋，而是冰屋，就像我梦见的一样。布恩迪亚家族将永远存在。”在这个离谱的家中，乌尔苏拉努力保持着正常，扩大了她的小动物糖果的生意，彻夜工作的烤箱产出一篮又一篮面包和各种各样的布丁、蛋白酥、曲奇饼，几个小时内就在通往沼泽区蜿蜒的路上销售一空。

She had reached an age where she had a right to rest, but she was nonetheless more and more active. So busy was she in her prosperous enterprises that one afternoon she looked distractedly toward the courtyard while the Indian woman helped her sweeten the dough and she saw two unknown and beautiful adolescent girls doing frame embroidery in the light of the sunset. They were Rebeca and Amaranta.<br />她已经到了有权享受生活的年龄，却越来越活跃，忙碌于她的繁荣事业。一天下午，印第安女人帮她往面团里加糖，她心烦意乱地看着院子里，看见两个陌生的美丽青春少女在暮色中绣花。她们是丽贝卡和阿玛兰塔。

As soon as they had taken off the mourning clothes for their grandmother, which they wore with inflexible rigor for three years, their bright clothes seemed to have given them a new place in the world. Rebeca, contrary to what might have been expected, was the more beautiful. She had a light complexion, large and peaceful eyes, and magical hands that seemed to work out the design of the embroidery with invisible threads.<br />她们严格地为外祖母守孝了三年，当她们脱掉丧服时，靓丽的衣服似乎给了她们一个新的世界。与预期的不同，丽贝卡更漂亮些，浅浅的肤色，大而宁静的眼睛，神奇的双手仿佛用无形的丝线绣出刺绣图案。

Amaranta, the younger, was somewhat graceless, but she had the natural distinction, the inner tightness of her dead grand-mother. Next to them, although he was already revealing the physical drive of his father, Arcadio looked like a child. He set about learning the art of silverwork with Aureliano, who had also taught him how to read and write.<br />阿玛兰塔更年轻，有几分的无礼，但她继承了过世外祖母的自然气质和自尊心。她们旁边，阿尔卡蒂奥看着像个孩子，虽然他已经显示出了父亲一样的身体素质。他开始跟随奥雷里亚诺学习银制工艺，奥雷里亚诺也指导他读书写字。

Úrsula suddenly realized that the house had become full of people, that her children were on the point of marrying and having children, and that they would be obliged to scatter for lack of space. Then she took out the money she had accumulated over long years of hard labor, made some arrangements with her customers, and undertook the enlargement of the house.<br />乌尔苏拉突然意识到家里人口众多，她的孩子们即将结婚生子，可能会因为缺乏空间而被迫分散。她拿出了多年辛苦劳动积累下来的钱，和工匠安排了一番，便开始对房屋进行扩建。

She had a formal parlor for visits built, another one that was more comfortable and cool for daily use, a dining room with a table with twelve places where the family could sit with all of their guests, nine bedrooms with windows on the courtyard and a long porch protected from the heat of noon by a rose garden with a railing on which to place pots of ferns and begonias.<br />计划中一间是为接待拜访而修建的正式客厅；另一间更加的舒适凉爽，为了日常的使用；还有一间餐厅，配有十二个座位的餐桌，方便家人和客人入座；九间卧室，窗户都朝向庭院；一条长廊，借着玫瑰花园的保护免受正午的暑气，栏杆上摆放着盆栽的蕨类和秋海棠。

She had the kitchen enlarged to hold two ovens. The granary where Pilar Ternera had read José Arcadio's future was torn down and another twice as large built so that there would never be a lack of food in the house. She had baths built is the courtyard in the shade of the chestnut tree, one for the women and another for the men, and in the rear a large stable, a fenced-in chicken yard, a shed for the milk cows, and an aviary open to the four winds so that wandering birds could roost there at their pleasure.<br />她扩大厨房，可以容纳两台烤箱。那个曾经皮拉尔·特尔内拉在里面预测何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥未来的旧谷仓被拆除，盖了一座两倍大的新谷仓，这样家里永远不会缺食物。她把浴室建在院子里栗树的树荫下，女人一间，男人一间。后面是一间马厩，一间带围栏的鸡舍，一间奶牛棚，一间四面通风，供流浪鸟儿自由栖息的鸟笼。

Followed by dozens of masons and carpenters, as if she had contracted her husband's hallucinating fever, Úrsula fixed the position of light and heat and distributed space without the least sense of its limitations. The primitive building of the founders became filled with tools and materials, workmen exhausted by sweat, who asked everybody please not to molest them, exasperated by the sack of bones that followed them everywhere with its dull rattle.<br />她仿佛感染上了丈夫的狂热，几十个泥水匠和木工紧随其后。她确定光和热的位置，不受限制的分配空间。村庄创建者的原始建筑里堆满了工具和材料，挤满了挥汗如雨精疲力尽的工人，他们要求人们不要来打扰他们，因为装有骨头的袋子到处跟着他们，总是发出咯咯声让人恼怒。

In that discomfort, breathing quicklime and tar, no one could see very well how from the bowels of the earth there was rising not only the largest house is the town, but the most hospitable and cool house that had ever existed in the region of the swamp. José Arcadio Buendía, trying to surprise Divine Providence in the midst of the cataclysm, was the one who least understood it.<br />在这个不适的环境中，呼吸着生石灰和焦油的气味。这座镇上甚至是沼泽区有史以来最大，也是最舒适凉爽的房子，没人能清楚的知道它是如何拔地而起的。在大变革中期试图发现上帝的何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚是最不理解这个问题的。

The new house was almost finished when Úrsula drew him out of his chimerical world in order to inform him that she had an order to paint the front blue and not white as they had wanted. She showed him the official document. José Arcadio Buendía, without understanding what his wife was talking about, deciphered the signature.<br />新房子已接近完工时，乌尔苏拉将他从异想天开的世界拉扯回来，为了告诉他有个指令要求他们将房子正面粉刷成蓝色，而不是他们想要的白色。她将官方批文给他看，何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚没有理解妻子在说什么，便看了眼署名。

"Who is this fellow?" he asked:<br />“这个人是谁？”他问：

"The magistrate," Úrsula answered disconsolately. They say he's an authority sent by the government."<br />“镇长，”乌尔苏拉愁闷地回答说。人们说他是由官方派出的权威。

Don Apolinar Moscote, the magistrate, had arrived in Macondo very quietly. He put up at the Hotel Jacob--built by one of the first Arabs who came to swap knickknacks for macaws-and on the following day he rented a small room with a door on the street two blocks away from the Buendía house. He set up a table and a chair that he had bought from Jacob, nailed up on the wall the shield of the republic that he had brought with him, and on the door he painted the sign: Magistrate.<br />堂·阿波利纳尔·摩斯柯特镇长悄无声息的来到马孔多，他下榻至雅各布酒店——由第一批来到这里用小装饰物交换金刚鹦鹉的阿拉伯人建造，第二天他租了一间门朝街道的小房子，与布恩迪亚家的房子隔着两个街区。他在雅各布酒店买了一桌一椅，把他带来的共和国国徽钉在墙上，并在门上绘上签署：镇长。

His first order was for all the houses to be painted blue in celebration of the anniversary of national independence. José Arcadio Buendía, with the copy of the order in his hand, found him taking his nap in a hammock he had set up in the narrow office.<br />他的第一个命令是所有的房子必须漆成蓝色，借此庆祝国家独立周年。何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚手里拿着命令的复印件，碰巧遇上他正在狭窄的办公室里设置的吊床上小睡。

"Did you write this paper?" he asked him. Don Apolinar Moscote, a mature man, timid, with a ruddy complexion, said yes. "By what right?" José Arcadio Buendía asked again. Don Apolinar Moscote picked up a paper from the drawer of the table showed it to him. "I have been named magistrate of this town."José Arcadio Buendía did not even look at the appointment.<br />“这个文件是你写的？”何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚问他。堂·阿波利纳尔·摩斯柯特是一个成熟的男人，羞怯，脸色红润，作了一个肯定的答复。“凭什么权力？”何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚又问他。堂·阿波利纳尔·摩斯柯特从桌子抽屉里抽出一张文件被他看。“我被任命为这个镇子的行政长官。”何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚看都没看这个任命。

"In this town we do not give orders with pieces of paper," he said without losing his calm. "And so that you know it once and for all, we don't need any judge here because there's nothing that needs judging."<br />“这个镇子不需要通过一张纸去下达命令，”话语间，不失沉稳。“你应该永远记住这一点，我们这不需要任何法官，因为我们没有任何事需要评判。”

Facing Don Apolinar Moscote, still without raising his voice, he gave a detailed account of how they had founded the village, of how they had distributed the land, opened the roads, introduced the improvements that necessity required without having bothered the government and without anyone having bothered them.<br />面对一言不发的堂·阿波利纳尔·摩斯柯特，他详细介绍了他们如何建立村庄，如何分配土地，开辟道路，介绍了必要的改进措施，而无需劳烦政府，也没有任何人打扰他们。

"We are so peaceful that none of us has died even of a natural death," he said. "You can see that we still don't have any cemetery." No once was upset that the government had not helped them. On the contrary, they were happy that up until then it had let them grow in peace, and he hoped that it would continue leaving them that way, because they had not founded a town so that the first upstart who came along would tell them what to do. Don Apolinar had put on his denim jacket, white like his trousers, without losing at any moment the elegance of his gestures.<br />他说：“我们生活安宁，甚至没有人自然死亡，你能看到我们还没有墓地。”没有人因为没有得到政府帮助而感到沮丧，恰恰相反，政府任其和平发展至今，他们为此而感到高兴。他希望以后也能继续如此，因为他们建立马孔多，不是为了让别人来告诉他们应该做什么。堂·阿波利纳尔·摩斯柯特穿上像裤子一样的白色牛仔夹克，时刻不忘举止优雅。

"So that if you want to stay here like any other ordinary citizen, you're quite welcome," José Arcadio Buendía concluded. "But if you've come to cause disorder by making the people paint their houses blue, you can pick up your junk and go back where you came from. Because my house is going to be white, white, like a dove."<br />“如果您想留在这做一个普通居民，您将会受到欢迎。但是，如果你通过让人们将房屋涂成蓝色来引起混乱，那么收拾好你的破烂，从哪来回哪去。我的房子将漆成白色！白得像鸽子一样！”

Don Apolinar Moscote turned pale. He took a step backward and tightened his jaws as he said with a certain affliction:<br />堂·阿波利纳尔·摩斯柯特脸色苍白，他后退一步，咬紧牙关，痛苦地说：

"I must warn you that I'm armed."<br />“我警告你，我有武器。”

José Arcadio Buendía did not know exactly when his hands regained the useful strength with which he used to pull down horses. He grabbed Don Apolinar Moscote by the lapels and lifted him up to the level of his eyes.<br />何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚不知道自己的双手究竟何时恢复了曾经撂翻马匹的强壮力量，他抓住堂·阿波利纳尔·摩斯柯特的衣领，将其举到眼前。

"I'm doing this," he said, "because I would rather carry you around alive and not have to keep carrying you around dead for the rest of my life."<br />“我这么做，”他说，“我宁愿让你活着，也不愿在我的余生中让你去死。”

In that way he carried him through the middle of the street, suspended by the lapels, until he put him down on his two feet on the swamp road. A week later he was back with six barefoot and ragged soldiers, armed with shotguns, and an oxcart in which his wife and seven daughters were traveling.<br />就这样，何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚带他穿过街道中央，一直揪着他的衣领，直到通往沼泽区的路上才将他放下来。一周后，他回来了，身边带着六个衣衫褴褛的赤脚士兵，全副武装，配着猎枪。还有一辆牛车，上面坐着正在旅途中的他的妻子和七个女儿。

Two other carts arrived later with the furniture, the baggage, and the household utensils. He settled his family in the Hotel Jacob, while he looked for a house, and he went back to open his office under the protection the soldiers. The founders of Macondo, resolving to expel the invaders, went with their older sons to put themselves at the disposal José Arcadio Buendía.<br />紧随其后到达的两辆车载满了家具、行李和家用器具。当他外出寻找房子时，他已将家人安顿在雅各布酒店。在士兵的保护下，他回到自己办公室。马孔多的创建者们决心驱逐这位侵略者，带上自己的大儿子，全由何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚安排。

But he was against it, as he explained, because it was not manly to make trouble for someone in front his family, and Don Apolinar had returned with his wife and daughters. So he decided to resolve the situation in a pleasant way.<br />但是，他反对这么做，他的解释是堂·阿波利纳尔·摩斯柯特带着妻子女儿回来，让他在家人面前蒙羞不是大丈夫的做法。所以他决定采用和平的方式化解当前的局面。

Aureliano went with him. About that time he had begun to cultivate the black mustache with waxed tips and the somewhat stentorian voice that would characterize him in the war. Unarmed, without paying any attention to the guards, they went into the magistrate's office. Don Apolinar Moscote did not lose his calm.<br />奥雷里亚诺跟在父亲旁边，那时他开始蓄着黑胡须，给胡尖打上蜡。在战争中，他的洪亮嗓音成为他的特征。他们赤手空拳，没有引起警卫的注意，当他们走进行政长官的办公室时，堂·阿波利纳尔·摩斯柯特镇定自若。

He introduced them to two of his daughters who happened to be there: Amparo, sixteen, dark like her mother, and Remedios, only nine, a pretty little girl with lily-colored skin and green eyes. They were gracious and well--mannered. As soon as the men came in, before being introduced, they gave them chairs to sit on. But they both remained standing.<br />他将他们介绍给碰巧在这的他的两个女儿：十六岁的安帕罗，像她母亲一样的深色皮肤，以及只有九岁的蕾梅黛丝，一个漂亮的小女孩，百合花色的皮肤和绿色的眼睛，她们彬彬有礼，风度翩翩。这些人一进来，介绍完毕，她们就给他们让座，自己却站着。

"Very well, my friend," José Arcadio Buendía said, "you may stay here, not because you have those bandits with shotguns at the door, but out of consideration for your wife and daughters."<br />“太好了，朋友，”何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚说，“你留下来不是因为门口带着枪的土匪，而是出于对妻子和女儿的考虑。”

Don Apolinar Moscote was upset, but José Arcadio Buendía did not give him time to reply. "We only make two conditions," he went on. "The first: that everyone can paint his house the color he feels like. The second: that the soldiers leave at once. We will guarantee order for you." The magistrate raised his right hand with all the fingers extended.<br />堂·阿波利纳尔·摩斯柯特很不高兴，但是何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚并没有给他反驳的时间。“我们只有两个条件，”他接着说。“第一个：所有人可以将自己的房子粉刷成自己喜欢的颜色，第二个：让士兵马上离开，我们会保障你的治安。”

"Your word of honor?"<br />“以荣誉担保？”

"The word of your enemy," José Arcadio Buendía said. And he added in a bitter tone: "Because I must tell you one thing: you and I are still enemies."<br />“以你的敌人担保，”何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚说。随后以一种严酷的语调说：“因为我得告诉你一件事：你我仍是敌人。”

The soldiers left that same afternoon. A few days later José Arcadio Buendía found a house for the magistrate's family. Everybody was at peace except Aureliano. The image of Remedios, the magistrate's younger daughter, who, because of her age, could have been his daughter, kept paining him in some part of his body. It was a physical sensation that almost bothered him when he walked, like a pebble in his shoe.<br />士兵当天下午便离开了。几天后，何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚为执法官一家找了一处居所。一切恢复了平静，除了奥雷里亚诺。执法官的小女儿蕾梅黛丝，按年纪都能当他的女儿了，但她的身影让他身体的某些部位饱受痛苦的折磨。那是一种肉体上的感觉，几乎影响到他的行走，就像鞋子里的小石子。
