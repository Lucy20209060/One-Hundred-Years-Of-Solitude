# Chapter 3

Pilar Ternera's son was brought to his grandparents' house two weeks after he was born. Úrsula admitted him grudgingly, conquered once more by the obstinacy of her husband, who could not tolerate the idea that an condition that the child should never know his true identity. <br />皮拉尔·特尔内拉的儿子在出生两星期以后被带到了祖父母家中。何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚不能容忍这种情况，除非不让这个孩子知道自己的真实身份，乌尔苏拉再次被丈夫的犟脾气打败，勉强接受了。

Although he was given the name José Arcadio, they ended up calling him simply Arcadio so as to avoid confudsion.<br />虽然他被命名为何塞·阿尔卡迪奥，但是最后他们干脆叫他阿尔卡蒂奥，以避免混淆。

At that time there was so much activity in the town and so much bustle in the house that the care of the children was relegated to a secondary level. They were put in the care of Visitación, a Guajiro Indian woman who had arrived in town with a brother in flight from a plague of insomnia that had been scourging their tribe for several years.<br />那个时候，镇上有很多活动，家里也甚是忙碌，照料孩子居于其次，托付给了维希塔西恩照料，她是一个瓜吉罗印第安女子，和兄弟逃离至此，因为失眠症折磨了他们的部落多年。

They were both so docile and willing to help that Úrsula took them on to help her with her household chores. That was how Arcadio and Amaranta came to speak the Guajiro language before Spanish, and they learned to drink lizard broth and eat spider eggs without Úrsula's knowing it, for she was too busy with a promising business in candy animals.<br />他们都很温顺，乐于助人，乌尔苏拉收留他们帮忙做家务。这就是为什么阿尔卡蒂奥和阿玛兰塔学会西班牙语之前先学会了说瓜吉罗语言，他们学会了喝蜥蜴汤，并且在乌尔苏拉不知情的情况下吃蜘蛛卵，而她正忙于大有前景的动物糖果生意。

Macondo had changed. The people who had come with Úrsula spread the news of the good quality of its soil and its privileged position with respect to the swamp, so that from the narrow village of past times it changed into an active town with stores and workshops and a permanent commercial route over which the first Arabs arrived with their baggy pants and rings in their ears, swapping glass beads for macaws.<br />马孔多变了，跟着乌尔苏拉过来的人四处宣传这里土地肥沃，地理位置比沼泽地优越，以至于这个往日狭小的村庄变成了一个熙熙攘攘的城镇，有了商店和工场，和一条永久的商业路线，第一批穿着布袋裤、戴着耳环的阿拉伯人通过这条路线来到这里，用玻璃珠交换金刚鹦鹉。

Emancipated for the moment at least from the torment of fantasy, José Arcadio Buendía in a short time set up a system of order and work which allowed for only one bit of license: the freeing of the birds, which, since the time of the founding, had made time merry with their flutes, and installing in their place musical clocks in every house.<br />至少从幻想的折磨中解脱出来的那一刻起，何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚在短时间内建立了一套秩序和工作的系统，只有一次被合法允许：放飞了自村庄建立以来的所有声音如长笛般的报时鸟，每家每户都安装了音乐时钟。

They were wondrous clocks made of carved wood, which the Arabs had traded for macaws and which José Arcadio Buendía had synchronized with such precision that every half hour the town grew merry with the progressive chords of the same song until it reached the climax of a noontime that was as exact and unanimous as a complete waltz.<br />

It was also José Arcadio Buendía who decided during those years that they should plant almond trees instead of acacias on the streets, and who discovered, without ever revealing it, a way to make them live forever. Many years later, when Macondo was a field of wooden houses with zinc roofs, the broken and dusty almond trees still stood on the oldest streets, although no one knew who had planted them.<br />
