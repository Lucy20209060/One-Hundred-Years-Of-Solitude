# Chapter 3

Pilar Ternera's son was brought to his grandparents' house two weeks after he was born. Úrsula admitted him grudgingly, conquered once more by the obstinacy of her husband, who could not tolerate the idea that an condition that the child should never know his true identity. <br />皮拉尔·特尔内拉的儿子在出生两星期以后被带到了祖父母家中。何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚不能容忍这种情况，除非不让这个孩子知道自己的真实身份，乌尔苏拉再次被丈夫的犟脾气打败，勉强接受了。

Although he was given the name José Arcadio, they ended up calling him simply Arcadio so as to avoid confudsion.<br />虽然他被命名为何塞·阿尔卡迪奥，但是最后他们干脆叫他阿尔卡蒂奥，以避免混淆。

At that time there was so much activity in the town and so much bustle in the house that the care of the children was relegated to a secondary level. They were put in the care of Visitación, a Guajiro Indian woman who had arrived in town with a brother in flight from a plague of insomnia that had been scourging their tribe for several years.<br />那个时候，镇上有很多活动，家里也甚是忙碌，照料孩子居于其次，托付给了维希塔西恩照料，她是一个瓜吉罗印第安女子，和兄弟逃离至此，因为失眠症折磨了他们的部落多年。

They were both so docile and willing to help that Úrsula took them on to help her with her household chores. That was how Arcadio and Amaranta came to speak the Guajiro language before Spanish, and they learned to drink lizard broth and eat spider eggs without Úrsula's knowing it, for she was too busy with a promising business in candy animals.<br />他们都很温顺，乐于助人，乌尔苏拉收留他们帮忙做家务。这就是为什么阿尔卡蒂奥和阿玛兰塔学会西班牙语之前先学会了说瓜吉罗语言，他们学会了喝蜥蜴汤，并且在乌尔苏拉不知情的情况下吃蜘蛛卵，而她正忙于大有前景的动物糖果生意。

Macondo had changed. The people who had come with Úrsula spread the news of the good quality of its soil and its privileged position with respect to the swamp, so that from the narrow village of past times it changed into an active town with stores and workshops and a permanent commercial route over which the first Arabs arrived with their baggy pants and rings in their ears, swapping glass beads for macaws.<br />马孔多变了，跟着乌尔苏拉过来的人四处宣传这里土地肥沃，地理位置比沼泽地优越，以至于这个往日狭小的村庄变成了一个熙熙攘攘的城镇，有了商店和工场，和一条永久的商业路线，第一批穿着布袋裤、戴着耳环的阿拉伯人通过这条路线来到这里，用玻璃珠交换金刚鹦鹉。

José Arcadio Buendía did not have a moment's rest. Fascinated by an immediate reality that came to be more fantastic that the vast universe of his imagination, he lost all interest in the alchemist's laboratory, put to rest the material that had become attenuated with months of manipulation, and went back to being the enterprising man of earlier days when he had decided upon the layout of the streets and the location of the new houses so that no one would enjoy privileges that everyone did not have.<br />何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚没有片刻休息，着迷于眼前的现实，想象力的广阔空间变得更加的奇妙，对炼金术士的实验室失去了所有的兴趣。他将操作了几个月效力逐渐降低的材料搁置一旁，变回了创业之初那个富有进取心的男人，那是他规划街道和房屋位置，人人平等，没有人能享受到其他人没有的特权。

He acquired such authority among the new arrivals that foundations were not laid or walls built without his being consulted, and it was decided that he should be the one in charge of the distribution of the land.<br />他在新来者人群中颇有权威，铺设地基、建造围墙都要找他征询意见，并且人们决定由他负责土地的分配。

When the acrobat gypsies returned, with their vagabond carnival transformed now into a gigantic organization of games of luck and chance that José Arcadio would be coming back with them.<br />吉普赛杂技演员回来时，他们的流浪者狂欢节现在变成了一个大型赌场，何塞·阿尔卡迪奥将会和他们一起回来。

But José Arcadio did not return, nor did they come with the snakeman, who, according to what úrsula thought, was the only one who could tell them about their son, so the gypsies were not allowed to camp in town or set foot in it in the future, for they were considered the bearers of concupiscence and perversion.<br />但是并没有回来，他们没有带着蛇人一起回来，根据乌尔苏拉的想法，蛇人是唯一知道她儿子下落的人。所以后来吉普赛人被禁止进入城镇，或在镇中安营扎寨，他们被认为是贪欲和变态的人。

José Arcadio Buendía, however, was explicit in maintaining that the old tribe of Melquíades, who had contributed so much to the growth of the village with his ageold wisdom and his fabulous inventions, would always find the gates open.But Melquíades' tribe, according to what the wanderers said, had been wiped off the face of the earth because they had gone beyond the limits of human knowledge.<br />然而，何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚明确地维护着梅尔基亚德斯的旧部落，他们以古老的智慧和优秀的发明，为村庄的发展做出了巨大的贡献，总能发现开放着的大门。但是根据流浪者所说，梅尔基亚德斯的部落已经从地球表面消失了，因为他们超越了人类知识的极限。

Emancipated for the moment at least from the torment of fantasy, José Arcadio Buendía in a short time set up a system of order and work which allowed for only one bit of license: the freeing of the birds, which, since the time of the founding, had made time merry with their flutes, and installing in their place musical clocks in every house.<br />至少从幻想的折磨中解脱出来的那一刻起，何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚在短时间内建立了一套秩序井然办事方法，只有一次被合法允许：放飞了自村庄建立以来的所有声音如长笛般的报时鸟，每家每户都安装了音乐时钟。

They were wondrous clocks made of carved wood, which the Arabs had traded for macaws and which José Arcadio Buendía had synchronized with such precision that every half hour the town grew merry with the progressive chords of the same song until it reached the climax of a noontime that was as exact and unanimous as a complete waltz.<br />这些神奇的时钟由木头雕刻而成，是从阿拉伯人那里用金刚鹦鹉交易而来。何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚校准精确，每半小时镇上便响起了同一首曲子的欢快和弦，一到中午便达到高潮，与完整的华尔兹一样精准一致。

It was also José Arcadio Buendía who decided during those years that they should plant almond trees instead of acacias on the streets, and who discovered, without ever revealing it, a way to make them live forever.<br />还有何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚在那些年决定在街道上应该种植杏仁树，而不是金合欢树，他发现了一种让树长生的方法，并且从未透露给别人。

Many years later, when Macondo was a field of wooden houses with zinc roofs, the broken and dusty almond trees still stood on the oldest streets, although no one knew who had planted them.<br />许多年以后，马孔多遍布镀锌屋顶的木屋，残败满是灰尘的杏仁树依旧矗立在古老的街道，尽管没人知道它们是由谁种植的。

While his father was putting the town in order and his mother was increasing their wealth with her marvelous business of candied little roosters and fish, which left the house twice a day strung along sticks of balsa wood, Aureliano spent interminable hours in the abandoned laboratory, learning the art of silverwork by his own experimentation.<br />父亲有序地整治城镇，母亲售卖小公鸡小鱼形状的蜜饯，通过这一非同一般的生意来提升财富，将蜜饯系在巴尔萨木棍上，每天两次出门兜售。奥雷里亚诺则经年累月地呆在废弃的实验室，通过自己的实验学习银制品工艺。

He had shot up so fast that in a short time the clothing left behind by his brother no longer fit him and he began to wear his father's, but Visitación had to sew pleats in the shirt and darts in the pants, because Aureliano had not sequined the corpulence of the others.<br />他的身体发育快速，哥哥的衣服不再合身，便开始穿父亲的衣服，只是需要维希塔西恩缝紧衬衫的活褶和裤子的死褶，因为奥雷里亚诺没有其他人那么肥胖。

Adolescence had taken away the softness of his voice and had made silent and definitely solitary, but, on the other hand, it had restored the intense expression that he had had in his eyes when he was born. He concentrated so much on his experiments in silverwork that he scarcely left the laboratory to eat.<br />青春期带走了他柔和的嗓音，变得沉默寡言，吊形吊影，但是另一方面，他眼中恢复了出生时的紧张表情。他专心致志于银制品工艺的实验，几乎没有离开过实验室去吃饭。

Worried ever his inner withdrawal, José Arcadio Buendía gave him the keys to the house and a little money, thinking that perhaps he needed a woman. But Aureliano spent the money on muriatic acid to prepare some aqua regia and he beautified the keys by plating them with gold.<br />何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚担心他心里打退堂鼓，给了他房子的钥匙和一点钱，认为他可能需要一个女人。但是奥雷里亚诺用钱买了盐酸，研制王水，通过镀金美化钥匙。

His excesses were hardly comparable to those of Arcadio and Amaranta, who had already begun to get their second teeth and still went about all day clutching at the Indians' cloaks, stubborn in their decision not to speak Spanish but the Guajiro language.<br />他的过激行为几乎不能和阿尔卡蒂奥和阿玛兰塔相比，他们已经开始长第二颗牙齿，整天抓着印第安人的斗篷，顽固地不肯说西班牙语，只说瓜吉罗语。

"You shouldn't complain." Úrsula told her husband. "Children inherit their parents' madness." And as she was lamenting her misfortune, convinced that the wild behavior of her children was something as fearful as a pig's tail, Aureliano gave a look that wrapped her in an atmosphere of uncertainty.<br />“你不应该抱怨。”乌尔苏拉对丈夫说。“孩子继承了他们父母的疯狂。”当她哀叹自己的不幸，深信孩子们的狂野行为如同猪尾巴一样可怕时，奥雷里亚诺看了她一眼，让她感到一片迷茫。

"Somebody is coming," he told her.<br />有人要来了，奥雷里亚诺告诉她。

Úrsula, as she did whenever he made a prediction, tried to break it down with her housewifely logic. It was normal for someone to be coming. Dozens of strangers came through Macondo every day without arousing suspicion or secret ideas. Nevertheless, beyond all logic, Aureliano was sure of his prediction.<br />每次他预言时，乌尔苏拉总是试图用家庭主妇的逻辑打破它。有人来是正常的，每天都会有几十个陌生人经过马孔多，并没有引起怀疑和外人不得而知的的意见，尽管如此，除去所有的逻辑，奥雷里亚诺仍然确信自己的预言。

"I don't know who it will be," he insisted, "but whoever it is is already on the way."<br />“我不知道会是谁，”他坚持说，“不管是谁，都已经在路上了。”

That Sunday, in fact, Rebeca arrived. She was only eleven years old. She had made the difficult trip from Manaure some hide dealers who had taken on the task of delivering her along with a letter to José Arcadio Buendía, but they could not explain precisely who the person was who had asked the favor. <br />果然，星期天丽贝卡来了，她只有十一岁。跟随玛纳乌勒的皮草商贩长途跋涉而来，他们受人之托，将丽贝卡连同一封信交给了何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚，但是他们说不清楚托付之人是谁。

Entire baggage consisted of a small trunk, a little rocking chair with small hand-painted flowers, and a canvas sack which kept making a cloc-cloc-cloc sound, where she carried parents' bones.<br />丽贝卡的所有行李包括一个小行李箱，一个带有手绘花卉的小摇椅，和一个不停地发出咳咯-咳咯-咳咯声音的帆布袋，里面装有她父母的遗骨。

The letter addressed to José Arcadio Buendía was written is very warm terms by someone who still loved him very much in spite of time and distance, and who felt obliged by a basic humanitarian feeling to do the charitable thing and send that poor unsheltered orphan, who was a second cousin of úrsula's and consequently also a relative of José Arcadio Buendía, although farther removed, because she was the daughter of that unforgettable friend Nicanor Ulloa and his very worthy wife Rebeca Montiel, may God keep them in His holy kingdom, whose remains the girl was carrying so that they might be given Christian burial.<br />这封写给何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚的信出自一个温情之人，尽管时间和距离的阻隔，他仍然非常爱他。基本的人道主义让他必须做这件慈善之事——送来这个无家可归的可怜孤儿。他是乌尔苏拉的第二个表兄弟，所以也是何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚的亲戚，尽管关系疏远。因为她是念念不忘的朋友尼康诺·努尔和其非常贤惠的妻子的女儿，愿上帝在神圣的国度里保佑他们，女孩带来的遗骸能给予一个基督教的葬礼。

The names mentioned, as well as the signature on the letter, were perfectly legible, but neither José Arcadio, Buendía nor úrsula remembered having any relatives with those names, nor did they know anyone by the name of the sender of the letter, much less the remote village of Manaure.<br />信中提及的名字和签名都非常的清晰，但是何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚和乌尔苏拉都不记得有这些名字的亲戚，也不认识信的寄件人，更别说玛纳乌勒这个遥远的乡村。

It was impossible to obtain any further information from the girl. From the moment she arrived she had been sitting in the rocker, sucking her finger and observing everyone with her large, startled eyes without giving any sign of understanding what they were asking her.<br />从女孩身上也无法获得任何进一步的信息。从她来了以后就一直坐在摇椅上，吮吸着手指，用惊愕的大眼睛观察着每个人，对于人们的询问一副不解的样子。

She wore a diagonally striped dress that had been dyed black, worn by use, and a pair of scaly patent leather boots. Her hair was held behind her ears with bows of black ribbon.<br />她穿着被染黑了的斜条纹的连衣裙，已经破旧了，一双脱了皮的皮靴。她的头发用一个黑色的蝴蝶结扎在耳朵后面。

She wore a scapular with the images worn away by sweat, and on her right wrist the fang of a carnivorous animal mounted on a backing of copper as an amulet against the evil eye.<br />身上肩衣的图案已被磨损，右手腕上戴着一个铜币，上面装着一枚食肉动物的犬牙，当作抵抗“邪恶之眼”的护身符。

Her greenish skin, her stomach, round and tense as a drum, revealed poor health and hunger that were older than she was, but when they gave her something to eat she kept the plate on her knees without tasting anything.<br />皮肤浅绿，肚子像鼓一样又圆又紧，表明了长期处于不健康与饥饿中。但是当他们给她一些吃食时，她把盘子放在膝盖上，没有品尝任何东西。

They even began to think that she was a deafmute until the Indians asked her in their language if she wanted some water and she moved her eyes as if she recognized them and said yes with her head.<br />他们甚至开始认为她是一个聋哑人，直到印第安人用他们的语言询问她是否需要喝点水时，她的眼睛一动，仿佛认出了他们，随即点了点头。

They kept her, because there was nothing else they could do. They decided to call her Rebeca, which according to the letter was her mother's name, because Aureliano had the patience to read to her the names of all the saints and he did not get a reaction from any one of them.<br />他们留下了她，除此之外也无能为力。奥雷里亚诺耐心地读完所有圣徒的名字，她毫无反应。所以根据她母亲的名字，他们决定称她为“丽贝卡”。

Since there was no cemetery in Macondo at that time, for no one had died up till then, they kept the bag of bones to wait for a worthy place of burial, and for a long time it got in the way everywhere and would be found where least expected, always with its clucking of a broody hen.<br />在那之前马孔多还没有人去世，所以当时还没有墓地。他们保存好装有遗骨的袋子，等待一个好的埋葬之地。很长一段时间，它们到处碍事，总是出现在意想不到的地方，不时发出母鸡抱窝时一样的咯咯声。

A long time passed before Rebeca became incorporated into the life of the family. She would sit in her small rocker sucking her finger in the most remote corner of the house. Nothing attracted her attention except the music of the clocks, which she would look for every half hour with her frightened eyes as if she hoped to find it someplace in the air.<br />丽贝卡很长时间才融入到这个家庭的生活，她总是在家里最偏僻的角落，坐在自己的小摇椅上，吮吸着手指。没有什么能吸引她的注意，除了钟表的报时音乐，每隔半小时她都瞪着惊恐的眼睛四处寻找，仿佛想在空中某处位置找到音乐。

They could not get her to eat for several days. No one understood why she had not died of hunger until the Indians, who were aware of everything, for they went ceaselessly about the house on their stealthy feet, discovered that Rebeca only liked to eat the damp earth of the courtyard and the cake of whitewash that she picked of the walls with her nails.<br />他们发现她几天都没有吃饭，没人能想通她为什么没被饿死，直到印第安人秘密而无休止地在家里走来走去，观察着每个地方，发现丽贝卡只喜欢吃院子里潮湿的泥土和用指甲从墙上扣下来的石灰皮。

It was obvious that her parents, or whoever had raised her, had scolded her for that habit because she did it secretively and with a feeling of guilt, trying to put away supplies so that she could eat when no one was looking. From then on they put her under an implacable watch.<br />显然，她的父母或者其他抚养过她的人因这一恶习责骂过她，因为她秘密而为，心怀愧疚。藏起吃食，在无人注意的时候吃掉。从那以后，她被严格监视着。

They threw cow gall onto the courtyard and, rubbed hot chili on the walls, thinking they could defeat her pernicious vice with those methods, but she showed such signs of astuteness and ingenuity to find some earth that úrsula found herself forced to use more drastic methods. <br />他们把牛胆汁洒在庭院里，把辣椒涂抹在墙壁上，认为用这些方法可以遏制住她的恶习。然而她寻找泥土时所表现的敏锐和聪明才智，让乌尔苏拉不得不采用更加严厉的方法。

She put some orange juice and rhubarb into a pan that she left in the dew all night and she gave her the dose the following day on an empty stomach. Although no one had told her that it was the specific remedy for the vice of eating earth, she thought that any bitter substance in an empty stomach would have to make the liver react.<br />她把橙汁和大黄放入盘中，整晚暴露在露水中，第二天让其空腹喝下一剂。虽然没人告诉她这是吃土恶习的具体补救措施，但他认为空腹吃任何苦涩的东西，都会让肝脏有所反应。

Rebeca was so rebellious and strong in spite of her frailness that they had to tie her up like a calf to make her swallow the medicine, they could barely keep back her kicks or bear up under the strange hieroglyphics that she alternated with her bites and spitting, and that, according to what the scandalized Indians said, were the vilest obscenities that one could ever imagine in their language.<br />丽贝卡如此的叛逆和坚强，尽管身体羸弱，为了让她喝药，他们不得不像捆绑一头小牛一样，无法制止她乱踢乱踹，以及又是咬人又是啐唾沫，还喊着奇怪的文字。印第安人十分震惊，说这是他们语言中所能想象出来的最肮脏淫秽的话。

When Úrsula discovered that, she added whipping to the treatment. It was never established whether it was the rhubarb or the beatings that had effect, or both of them together, but the truth was that in a few weeks Rebeca began to show signs of recovery. She took part in the games of Arcadio and Amaranta, who treated her like an older sister, and she ate heartily, using the utensils properly.<br />乌尔苏拉知道后，将鞭打加入到了疗法中。她也不确定最后是大黄还是笞打，抑或二者共同作用下起了效果，事实是，几周内丽贝卡有了改善的迹象。她加入到了阿尔卡迪奥和阿玛兰塔的玩耍中，他们像对待姐姐一样对待她。她开始正确地使用餐具，尽情地吃饭。

It was soon revealed that she spoke Spanish with as much fluency as the Indian language, that she had a remarkable ability for manual work, and that she could sing the waltz of the clocks with some very funny words that she herself had invented. It did not take long for them to consider her another member of the family.<br />很快就发现，她说的西班牙语和印第安语一样流利，有着出色的手工能力。她能用自己编造的一些有趣的歌词演唱时钟的华尔兹舞曲。很快她被接纳了，成为了家庭的新成员。

She was more affectionate to Úrsula than any of her own children had been, and she called Arcadio, Amaranta brother and sister, Aureliano uncle, and José Arcadio Buendía grandpa. So that she finally deserved, as much as the others, the name of Rebeca Buendía, the only one that she ever had and that she let with dignity until her death.<br />她与乌尔苏拉非常亲密，甚至超过了其他孩子和乌尔苏拉的亲密程度。她称阿尔卡蒂奥和阿玛兰塔为弟弟妹妹，称奥雷里亚诺为叔叔，称何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚为爷爷。所以最后和其他人一样，她名字应该叫丽贝卡·布恩迪亚，这是她唯一拥有的名字，让她体面的活着直到终老。

One night about the time that Rebeca was cured of the vice of eating earth and was brought to sleep in the other children's room, the Indian woman, who slept them awoke by chance and heard a strange, intermittent sound in the corner. She got up in alarm, thinking that an animal had come into the room, and then she saw Rebeca in the rocker, sucking her finger and with her eyes lighted up in the darkness like those of a cat.<br />丽贝卡改掉吃土的恶习后，被带到其他孩子的房间睡觉。一天晚上，印第安女人偶然醒来，听到角落里传来一阵断断续续的奇怪声音。她焦急万分，以为有动物闯进了房间。然后看到丽贝卡坐在摇椅上，吮吸着手指，在黑暗中她的眼睛犹如猫眼一般发着光。

Terrified, exhausted by her fate, Visitación recognized in those eyes the symptoms of the sickness whose threat had obliged her and her brother to exile themselves forever from an ageold kingdom where they had been prince and princess. It was the insomnia plague.<br />命运中的恐惧、疲惫不堪，维希塔西恩从她的眼中人认出了这种疾病的症状，正是这种疾病迫使她和兄弟由一个古老王国的公主和王子变成了永远流亡在外的人。这就是失眠症。

Cataure, the Indian, was gone from the house by morning. His sister stayed because her fatalistic heart told her that the lethal sickness would follow her, no matter what, to the farthest corner of the earth. No one understood Visitación's alarm.<br />早上，印第安人卡塔乌雷离开了。他的姐姐留下来了，因为听天由命的内心告诉她：无论走到天涯海角，致命的疾病永远跟随着她。没有人理解维希塔西恩的忧虑。

"If we don't ever sleep again, so much the better," José Arcadio Buendía said in good humor. "That way we can get more out of life." But the Indian woman explained that the most fearsome part of the sickness of insomnia was not the impossibility of sleeping, for the body did not feel any fatigue at all, but its inexorable evolution toward a more critical manifestation: a loss of memory.<br />“如果我们不能睡觉，那就太好了，”何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚幽默地说，“那我们就获得更多的寿命了。”但是印第安女人解释说失眠症最可怕的不是因为身体根本感觉不到任何疲倦而睡不着，而是残酷地发展为一种更加严重的表现：失忆。

She meant that when the sick person became used to his state of vigil, the recollection of his childhood began to be erased from his memory, then the name and notion of things, and finally the identity of people and even the awareness of his own being, until he sank into a kind of idiocy that had no past.<br />她的意思是，当病人习惯了失眠状态，童年回忆便开始从记忆中消失，然后是事物的名称和概念，最后是人的身份，甚至是自己的意识，直到沦陷到没有过去的糊涂之中。

José Arcadio Buendía, dying with laughter, thought that it was just a question of one of the many illnesses invented by the Indians' superstitions. But Úrsula, just to be safe, took the precaution of isolating Rebeca from the other children.<br />何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚差点笑死，认为这只是众多疾病中印第安迷信编造出来的一个问题。但是乌尔苏拉为了安全起见，做了个预防措施，将丽贝卡和其他孩子隔离开来。

After severval weeks, when Visitación's terror seemed to have died down, José Arcadio Buendía found himself rolling over in bed, unable to fall asleep. Úrsula, who had also awakened, asked him what was wrong, and he answered: "I'm thinking about Prudencio Aguilar again." They did not sleep a minute, but the following day they felt so rested that they forget about the bad night.<br />几周以后，当维希塔西恩的恐惧似乎消失了时，何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚发现自己在床上翻来覆去，无法安睡。乌尔苏拉被吵醒了，问他出了什么问题，他回答说他又想起了普鲁登西奥·阿吉拉尔。他们一分钟也没睡，但是第二天他们感觉精力充沛，便忘了这个糟糕的夜晚。

Arcadio commented with surprise at lunchtime that he felt very well in spite of the fact that he had spent the whole night in the laboratory gilding a brooch that he planned to give to Úrsula for her birthday. They did not become alarmed until the third day, when no one felt sleepy at bedtime and they realized that they had gone more that fifty hours without sleeping.<br />午餐时间，阿尔卡蒂奥惊讶地评论说，尽管整夜呆在实验室做一个计划乌尔苏拉生日时送给她的胸针，但他感觉依然很好。直到第三天他们都没有感到惊慌，当他们躺在床上却毫无睡意时，于是意识到他们已经超过五十个小时没有睡觉了。

"The children are awake too," the Indian said with her fatalistic conviction. "Once it gets into a house no one can escape the plague."<br />“孩子们也醒着,”印第安人带着宿命论的信念说，“一旦进入房间，没人可以逃脱瘟疫。”

They had indeed contracted the illness of insomnia. Úrsula, who had learned from her mother the medicinal value plants, prepared and made them all drink a brew of monkshood, but they could not get to sleep and spent the whole day dreaming on their feet. In that state hallucinated lucidity, not only did they see the images of their own dreams, but some saw the images dreamed by others.<br />他们的确感染了失眠症。乌尔苏拉曾经从母亲那里学会了辨识具有药用价值的植物，让他们所有人喝下一剂川乌，但是仍然不能入睡，整天站着做梦。在幻觉清醒的状态下，不仅看到了自己梦中的景象，还能看到其他人梦中的景象。

It was as if the house were full of visitors. Sitting in her rocker in a corner of the kitchen, Rebeca dreamed that a man who looked very much like her, dressed in white linen and with his shirt collar closed by a gold button, was bringing her a bouquet of roses.<br />房间里好像有很多游客。丽贝卡坐在厨房角落里的摇椅上，梦境中看到一个长得非常像自己的男人，身穿白色亚麻布衣服，衬衫领子上扣着一个金色纽扣，给她带来一束玫瑰花。

He was accompanied by a woman delicate hands who took out one rose put it in the child's hair. Úrsula understood that the man and woman were Rebeca's parents, but even though she made a great effort to recognize them, she confirmed her certainty that she had never seen them.<br />一个女人挽着他，纤细的手中拿着一朵玫瑰，然后把花别在丽贝卡的头发上。乌尔苏拉明白这两个人是丽贝卡的父母，但她努力辨认，确信自己肯定从来没见过他们。

In the meantime, through an oversight that José Arcadio Buendía never forgave himself for, the candy animals made in the house were still being sold in the town. Children and adults sucked with delight on the delicious little green roosters of insomnia, the exquisite pink fish of insomnia, and the tender yellow ponies insomnia, so that dawn on Monday found the whole town awake.<br />与此同时，何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚永远不能原谅自己，由于他的一时疏忽，家里的动物糖果仍在镇上售卖。大人小孩高兴地吮吸着美味的感染了失眠症的小绿公鸡、精致的粉红色鱼儿、细嫩的黄色小马驹，以至于在星期一的早晨，发现整个镇子都清醒着。

No one was alarmed at first. On the contrary, they were happy at not sleeping because there was so much to do in Macondo in those days that there was barely enough time. They worked so hard that soon they had nothing else to do and they could be found at three o'clock in the morning with their arms crossed, counting the notes in the waltz of the clock.<br />起初没有人为此惊慌，相反，他们因为不用睡觉感到非常高兴，因为那时马孔多有太多的事情要做，几乎没有足够的时间。他们努力工作，很快便无事可做。凌晨三点，他们交叉着双手，数着时钟里华尔兹舞曲的音符。

Those who wanted to sleep, not from fatigue but because of the nostalgia for dreams, tried all kinds of methods of exhausting themselves. They would gather togetto converse endlessly, to tell over and over for hours on end the same jokes, to complicate to the limits of exasperation the story about the capon, which was an endless game in which the narrator asked if they wanted him to tell them the story about the capon, and when they answered yes, the narrator would say that he had not asked them to say yes, but whether they wanted him to tell them the story about the capon, and when they answered no, the narrator told them that he had not asked them to say no, but whether they wanted him to tell them the story about the capon, and when they remained silent the narrator told them that he had not asked them to remain silent but whether they wanted him to tell them the story about the capon, and no one could leave because the narrator would say that he had not asked them to leave but whether they wanted him to tell them the story about the capon, and so on and on in a vicious circle that lasted entire nights.<br />那些想睡觉的人，不是由于疲倦，而是因为怀念做梦，于是尝试各种方法让自己筋疲力尽。他们聚在一起谈论不休，一遍又一遍讲着同一个的笑话，一个复杂得让人恼怒至极的关于阉鸡的故事。这是一个永无止境的游戏，叙述者询问他们是否希望让他讲一个关于阉鸡的故事，当他们回答“是”的时候，叙述者则说他并没有要求他们回答“是”，而是询问他们是否希望让他讲一个关于阉鸡的故事；当他们回答“否”的时候，叙述者又说他并没有要求他们回答“否”，而是询问他们是否希望让他讲一个关于阉鸡的故事；当他们保持沉默，叙述者又说他没有要求他们保持沉默，而是询问他们是否希望让他讲一个关于阉鸡的故事；也没人离开，因为叙述者会说他没有要求他们离开，而是询问他们是否希望让他讲一个关于阉鸡的故事。依此类推，这种恶行循环持续了一整晚。

When José Arcadio Buendía realized that the plague had invaded the town, he gathered together the heads of families to explain to them what he knew about the sickness of insomnia, and they agreed on methods to prevent the scourge from spreading to other towns in the swamp.<br />当何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚意识到瘟疫已经侵袭整个镇子时，他召集家长，向他们讲解他对失眠症的了解。他们同意采取措施防止灾害蔓延至沼泽地的其他城镇。

That was why they took the bells off the goats, bells that the Arabs had swapped them for macaws, and put them at the entrance to town at the disposal of those who would not listen to the advice and entreaties of the sentinels and insisted on visiting the town.<br />他们取下山羊的铃铛，铃铛是从阿拉伯人那里用金刚鹦鹉换来的，把它们放在小镇的入口处，提供给那些不听从哨兵的劝告哀求，执意访问马孔多的人使用。

All strangers who passed through the streets of Macondo at that time had to ring their bells so that the sick people would know that they were healthy. They were not allowed to eat or drink anything during their stay, for there was no doubt but that the illness was transmitted by mouth, all food and drink had been contaminated by insomnia.<br />当时所有经过马孔多街道的外人必须摇响铃铛，以便让病人们知道他们是健康的。逗留期间他们禁止饮食，因为毫无疑问，病从口入，所有的食物饮品都被失眠症污染。

In that way they kept the plague restricted to the perimeter of the town. So effective was the quarantine that the day came when the emergency situation was accepted as a natural thing and life was organized in such a way that work picked up its rhythm again and no one worried any more about the useless habit of sleeping.<br />通过这种方式，他们将瘟疫限制在小镇周边范围内。隔离非常的奏效，这种紧急状态大家已习以为常，生活步入正轨，工作再次恢复节奏，没有人再担心失去无益的睡眠习惯。

It was Aureliano who conceived the formula that was to protect them against loss of memory for several months. He discovered it by chance. An expert insomniac, having been one of the first, he had learned the art of silverwork to perfection. One day he was looking for the small anvil that he used for laminating metals and he could not remember its name.<br />几个月来，奥雷里亚诺想出了保护大家防止失忆的主意，他是在偶然中发现的。作为第一批失眠症的资深患者，他完全掌握了银制品工艺。一天他正在寻找小号的铁砧（锻捶金属用的垫座），用于金属压层，但是忘了它的名称。

His father told him: "Stake." Aureliano wrote the name on a piece of paper that he pasted to the base of the small anvil: stake. In that way he was sure of not forgetting it in the future. It did not occur to him that this was the first manifestation of a loss of memory, because the object had a difficult name to remember.<br />父亲告诉他是“铁桩”，奥雷里亚诺把这个名称写在一张纸上，并把它贴在小号铁砧的底部。通过这种方式他确信以后再也不会忘记，他也没发觉这是失忆的第一个表现，因为这玩意儿确实有个难记的名称。

But a few days later be, discovered that he had trouble remembering almost every object in the laboratory. Then he marked them with their respective names so that all he had to do was read the inscription in order to identify them.<br />几天后，他发现自己很难记住实验室里每件东西的名称，于是他用它们各自的名称做好标记，以至于为了辨别它们不得不阅读纸上的文字。

When his father told him about his alarm at having forgotten even the most impressive happenings of his childhood, Aureliano explained his method to him, and José Arcadio Buendía put it into practice all through the house and later on imposed it on the whole village.<br />父亲把自己忧虑告诉了奥雷里亚诺，说他甚至忘记了童年最美好的事情，奥雷里亚诺向他说明了自己的方法。何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚首先在家里付诸行动，后来这种方法推行到了整个小镇。

With an inked brush he marked everything with its name: table, chair, clock, door, wall, bed, pan. He went to the corral and marked the animals and plants: cow, goat, pig, hen, cassava, caladium, banana. Little by little, studying the infinite possibilities of a loss of memory, he realized that the day might come when things would be recognized by their inscriptions but that no one would remember their use. Then he was more explicit.<br />他用签字笔标识每件物品的名字：桌子、椅子、时钟、门、墙、床、锅。他走进畜栏，标识动植物：奶牛、山羊、猪、母鸡、木薯、香蕉。逐渐地，在研究失忆的无限可能性过程中，他意识到即使通过文字认识东西，有朝一日也会忘记它们的用途。

The sign that he hung on the neck of the cow was an exemplary proof of the way in which the inhabitants of Macondo were prepared to fight against loss of memory: This is the cow. She must be milked every morning so that she will produce milk, and the milk must be boiled in order to be mixed with coffee to make coffee and milk.<br />他挂在牛脖子上的牌子就是马孔多居民做好准备对抗失忆的典型例子：这是奶牛。它必须每天早上挤奶，以便生产奶，牛奶必须煮沸才能和咖啡混合制成牛奶咖啡。

Thus they went on living in a reality that was slipping away, momentarily captured by words, but which would escape irremediably when they forgot the values the written letters.<br />就这样，他们继续生活在逐渐遗忘的现实中，但是当他们忘记书面文字的作用时，这种依赖文字才能保存的现实也将一去不返。

At the beginning of the road into the swamp they put up a sign that said MACONDO and another larger one on the main street that said GOD EXISTS. In all the houses keys to memorizing objects and feelings had been written.<br />在通往沼泽地的路口，他们竖起一个牌子，上面写着：马孔多；在主干街道上还有一个更大的牌子，上面写着：上帝存在。每家每户都写着记住物品和情感的要点。

But the system demanded so much vigilance and moral strength that many succumbed to the spell of an imaginary reality, one invented by themselves, which was less practical for them but more comforting. Pilar Ternera was the one who contributed most to popularize that mystification when she conceived the trick of reading the past in cards as she had read the future before. <br />但是这套系统需要高度的警觉和道德力量，以至于很多人抵挡不住虚拟现实的魅力，自我幻想，虽不切实际，但令人安慰。皮拉尔·特尔内拉是推广这种故弄玄虚贡献最大的人，她在阅读未来之前就曾构想过通过纸牌阅读过去的戏法。

By means of that recourse the insomniacs began to live in a world built on the uncertain alternatives of the cards, where a father was remembered faintly as the dark man who had arrived at the beginning of April and a mother was remembered only as the dark woman who wore a gold ring on her left hand, and where a birth date was reduced to the last Tuesday on which a lark sang in the laurel tree. <br />通过这种依赖的方式，失眠患者开始生活在由纸牌产生的飘忽不定可供选择的世界里。在那里，模糊地记得父亲皮肤黝黑，是四月初来到这的；母亲则只记得皮肤黝黑，左手戴着金戒指，出生日期简化为百灵鸟在月桂树上歌唱的最后一个星期二。

Defeated by those practices of consolation, José Arcadio Buendía then decided to build the memory machine that he had desired once in order to remember the marvelous inventions of the gypsies. The artifact was based on the possibility of reviewing every morning, from beginning to end, the totality of knowledge acquired during one's life.<br />何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚无奈于这种寻求慰藉的做法，他决定制造一种曾经想用来记录吉普赛人的神奇发明的的记忆机器。该装置的基础功能是：每天清晨将人一生中获得的知识从有到尾复习一遍。

He conceived of it as a spinning dictionary that a person placed on the axis could operate by means of a lever, so that in a very few hours there would pass before his eyes the notions most necessary for life. He had succeeded in writing almost fourteen thousand entries when along the road from the swamp a strange-looking old man with the sad sleepers' bell appeared, carrying a bulging suitcase tied with a rope and pulling a cart covered with black cloth. He went straight to the house of José Arcadio Buendía.<br />他设想它是一个快速旋转的辞典，人坐在枢纽上，操作控制杆，短短几个小时内生活中必要的概念从眼前经过。当他成功地写下将近一万四千条记录时，悲凉的睡眠者铃声响起，一个样子奇怪的老人沿着道路从沼泽地走来，载着一个扎满绳子鼓鼓囊囊的箱子，拉着一个黑布覆盖着的推车，径直来到何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚的家中。

Visitación did not recognize him when she opened the door she thought he had come with the idea of selling something, unaware that nothing could be sold in a town that was sinking irrevocably into the quick-sand of forgetfulness.<br />维希塔西恩打开门的时候并没有认出他，以为他来这售卖东西，却没有察觉到这个深陷失忆流沙中的小镇无物可卖。

He was a decrepit man. Although his voice was also broken by uncertainty and his hands seemed to doubt the existence of things, it was evident that he came from the world where men could still sleep and remember.<br />老人年迈体弱，尽管嗓音断断续续，双手摸摸索索，显然他来自一个人们依旧可以睡觉和记忆的世界。

José Arcadio Buendía found him sitting in the living room fanning himself with a patched black hat as he read with compassionate attention the signs pasted to the walls. He greeted him with a broad show of affection, afraid that he had known him at another time and that he did not remember him now.<br />何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚发现他坐在客厅，用打着补丁的黑色帽子扇着风，充满同情地看着贴在墙上的字条。何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚非常热情地迎接了他，害怕自己以前认识他，只是如今已不记得他了。

But the visitor was aware his falseness, He felt himself forgotten, not with the irremediable forgetfulness of the heart, but with a different kind of forgetfulness, which was more cruel and irrevocable and which he knew very well because it was the forgetfulness of death.<br />来访者察觉到了他的伪装，并感觉到了自己已被遗忘。他非常清楚这不是内心暂时的遗忘，而是一种不同的，更加残酷和无法挽回的遗忘，因为这是对死亡的遗忘。

Then he understood. He opened the suitcase crammed with indecipherable objects and from among then he took out a little case with many flasks. He gave José Arcadio Buendía a drink of a gentle color and the light went on in his memory.<br />于是便明白了，他打开装满不知道什么东西的手提箱，从其中拿出装着许多瓶子的小盒子。他把一瓶颜色柔和的液体给了何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚，喝完马上便恍然大悟。

His eyes became moist from weeping even before he noticed himself in an absurd living room where objects were labeled and before he was ashamed of the solemn nonsense written on the walls, and even before he recognized the newcomer with a dazzling glow of joy. It was Melquíades.<br />他眼睛湿润了，看到自己身处物品贴满标签的荒唐的客厅，羞愧于写在墙上的庄重的废话。然后他兴高采烈地认出了新来者，他是梅尔基亚德斯。

While Macondo was celebrating the recovery of its memory, José Arcadio Buendía and Melquíades dusted off their old friendship. The gypsy was inclined to stay in the town. He really had been through death, but he had returned because he could not bear the solitude.<br />全镇都在庆祝记忆的恢复，何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚和梅尔基亚德斯也重拾了旧日的友谊。吉普赛人想留在小镇上，他们经历了死亡，再也无法忍受孤独，所以他们回来了。

Repudiated by his tribe, having lost all of his supernatural faculties because of his faithfulness to life, he decided to take refuge in that corner of the world which had still not been discovered by death, dedicated to the operation a daguerreotype laboratory. José Arcadio Buendía had never heard of that invention.<br />被自己的部落拒绝在外，由于忠于生活，失去了超自然之力。他决定在世界那个尚未被死亡发现的角落避难，操办一间银版摄影术实验室，何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚从未听说过这项发明。

But when he saw himself and his whole family fastened onto a sheet of iridescent metal for an eternity, he was mute with stupefaction. That was the date of the oxidized daguerreotype in which José Arcadio Buendía appeared with his bristly and graying hair, his card board collar attached to his shirt by a copper button, and an expression of startled solemnity, whom úrsula described, dying with laughter, as a "frightened general." 

José Arcadio Buendía was, in fact, frightened on that dear December morning when the daguerreotype was made, for he was thinking that people were slowly wearing away while his image would endure an a metallic plaque. Through a curious reversal of custom, it was úrsula who got that idea out of his head, as it was also she who forgot her ancient bitterness decided that Melquíades would stay on in the house, although she never permitted them to make a daguerreotype of her because (according to her very words) she did not want to survive as a laughingstock for her grandchildren. 

That morning she dressed the children in their best clothes, powdered their faces, and gave a spoonful of marrow syrup to each one so that they would all remain absolutely motionless during the nearly two minutes in front of Melquíades fantastic camera. In the family daguerreotype, the only one that ever existed, Aureliano appeared dressed in black velvet between Amaranta and Rebeca. 

He had the same languor and the same clairvoyant look that he would have years later as he faced the firing squad. But he still had not sensed the premonition of his fate. He was an expert silversmith, praised all over the swampland for the delicacy of his work. 

In the workshop, which he shared with Melquíades' mad laboratory, he could barely be heard breathing. He seemed to be taking refuge in some other time, while his father and the gypsy with shouts interpreted the predictions of Nostradamus amidst a noise flasks and trays and the disaster of spilled acids and silver bromide that was lost in the twists and turns it gave at every instant. 

That dedication to his work, the good judgment with which he directed his attention, had allowed Aureliano to earn in a short time more money than úrsula had with her delicious candy fauna, but everybody thought it strange that he was now a fullgrown man and had not known a woman. It was true that he had never had one.

Several months later saw the return of Francisco the Man, as ancient vagabond who was almost two hundred years old and who frequently passed through Macondo distributing songs that he composed himself. In them Francisco the Man told in great detail the things that had happened in the towns along his route, from Manaure to the edge of the swamp, so that if anyone had a message to send or an event to make public, he would pay him two cents to include it in his repertory. 

That was how úrsula learned of the death of her mother, as a simple consequence of listening to the songs in the hope that they would say something about her son José Arcadio. Francisco the Man, called that because he had once defeated the devil in a duel of improvisation, and whose real name no one knew, disappeared from Macondo during the insomnia plague and one night he appeared suddenly in Catarino's store. 

The whole town went to listen to him to find out what had happened in the world. On that occasion there arrived with him a woman who was so fat that four Indians had to carry her in a rocking chair, and an adolescent mulatto girl with a forlorn look who protected her from the sun with an umbrella. 

Aureliano went to Catarino's store that night. He found Francisco the Man, like a monolithic chameleon, sitting in the midst of a circle bystanders. He was singing the news with his old, out-of-tune voice, accompanying himself with the same archaic accordion that Sir Walter Raleigh had given him in the Guianas and keeping time with his great walking feet that were cracked from saltpeter. 

In front of a door at the rear through which men were going and coming, the matron of the rocking chair was sitting and fanning herself in silence. Catarino, with a felt rose behind his ear, was selling the gathering mugs of fermented cane juice, and he took advantage of the occasion to go over to the men and put his hand on them where he should not have. 

Toward midnight the heat was unbearable. Aureliano listened to the news to the end without hearing anything that was of interest to his family. He was getting ready to go home when the matron signaled hand.
