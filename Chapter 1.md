# Chapter 1

Many years later as he face the firing squad, Colonel Aureliano Buendía was to remember that distant afternoon when his father took him to discover ice.<br />多年以后，奥雷里亚诺·布恩迪亚上校面对行刑队，想起了小时候父亲带他参观冰块的那个遥远的下午（他们从来没有见过冰，觉得这是很神奇的东西）。

At the time Macodo was village of twenty adobe houses, build on the bank of a river of clear water that ran along a bedof polished stones, while were while and enormous, like prehistoris eggs.<br />那时的马孔多还是一个只有二十户土坯房的小村庄，建立在河岸上，河水清澈，沿着遍布石头的河床流去，河里的石头像史前遗留的巨蛋。

The world was so recent that many things lacked names, and in order to indicate them it was necessary to point.<br />这块新开辟的地方，许多东西都没有名字，提到它们时不得不用手比划出来。

Every year during the month of March a family of ragged gypsies would set up their tents near the village, and with a great uproar of pipes and kettle drums they would display new inventions.<br />每年三月，一家衣衫褴褛的吉普赛人在村庄旁边搭起帐篷，在喧嚣的笛鼓音乐中，向这里的居民展示他们的最新发明。

First they brought the magnet. A heavy gypsy with an untamed beard and sparrow hands, who introduced himself as Melquíades, put on a bold public demonstration of what he himself called the eighth wonder of the learned alchemists of Macedonia.<br />首先他们带来的是磁铁。一个健硕的吉普赛人，满脸络腮胡，手像麻雀的爪子，自称梅尔基亚德斯。他自信地向人们展示他所谓的马其顿炼金术士创造的世界第八奇迹。

He went from house to house dragging two metal ingots and everybody was amazed to see pots, pans, tongs, and braziers tumble down from their places and beams creak from the desperation of nails and screws trying to emerge, and even objects that had been lost for a long time appeared from where they had been searched for most and went dragging along in turbulent confusion behind Melquíades' magical irons.<br />他拖着两块金属锭，从一个房子走到另一个房子，大家都惊讶地看到铁壶，铁锅，铁钳，铁盆纷纷滚落下来。房梁因拼命挣扎的钉子和奋力挣脱的螺丝而吱嘎作响。很多丢失多日的物件也被搜寻了出来，杂乱地跟随在梅尔基亚德斯的魔铁后面。

"Things have a life of their own," the gypsy proclaimed with a harsh accent. "It's simply a matter of waking up their souls." José Arcadio Buendía, whose unbridled imagination always went beyond the genius of nature and even beyond miracles and magic, thought that it would be possible to make use of that useless invention to extract gold from the bowels of the earth.<br />“万物皆有灵性，”吉普赛人用刺耳的口音说道。“只需要唤醒它们的灵性。”何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚远超大自然的创造力，甚至超越了奇迹和魔法。他想到可以使用这个无用的发明用来提取地下的黄金。

Melquíades, who was an honest man, warned him: "It won't work for that." But José Arcadio Buendía at that time did not believe in the honesty of gypsies, so he traded his mule and a pair of goats for the two magnetized ingots.<br />梅尔基亚德斯是一个诚实的人，他警告道：“这个做不到。”然而当时何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚并不相信这个诚实的吉普赛人。他用一头骡子和一对山羊换了那两个磁铁。

Úrsula Iguarán, his wife, who relied on those animals to increase their poor domestic holdings, was unable to dissuade him. "Very soon well have gold enough and more to pave the floors of the house," her husband replied. <br />他的妻子乌尔苏拉·伊瓜兰没能阻止住他，她本想指望着这些家畜改善贫困的家业。“用不了多久，我们就会有足够的金子，多到可以铺满房子”，他的丈夫说道。

For several months he worked hard to demonstrate the truth of his idea. He explored every inch of the region, even the riverbed, dragging the two iron ingots along and reciting Melquíades' incantation aloud.<br />几个月以来，他努力想证明自己的想法是真的。他探索着这个地区的每一块区域，甚至是河床，拖着两个铁锭，口里大声念着梅尔基亚德斯的咒语。<br /> <br />The only thing he succeeded in doing was to unearth a suit fifteenth-century armor which had all of its pieces soldered together with rust and inside of which there was the hollow resonance of an enormous stone-filled gourd.<br />他唯一成功的事是发现了一套十五世纪的盔甲，锈迹斑斑，敲几下发出空洞的回声，像一个塞满石头的大葫芦。<br /> <br />When José Arcadio Buendía and the four men of his expedition managed to take the armor apart, they found inside a calcified skeleton with a copper locket containing a woman's hair around its neck.<br />当何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚和四个跟随他一起考察的男人打开这个盔甲时，发现里面一副已经钙化的骨架，脖子上挂着一个铜制的盒子，里面装着一缕女人的头发。

In March the gypsies returned. This time they brought a telescope and a magnifying glass the size of a drum, which they exhibited as the latest discovery of the Jews of Amsterdam. <br />三月，吉普赛人又来了。这时他们带来了一架望远镜和一个大小跟鼓一样的放大镜，他们展示时说是阿姆斯特丹的犹太人的最新发明。

They placed a gypsy woman at one end of the village and set up the telescope at the entrance to the tent. For the price of five reales, people could look into the telescope and see the gypsy woman an arm's length away.<br />他们让一个吉普赛人坐在村庄的一头，把望远镜架在帐篷的入口。花费五个reales(钱币？)，人们便可以通过望远镜看到吉普赛女人只有一臂之遥，近在眼前。

"Science has eliminated distance," Melquíades proclaimed. "in a short time, man will be able to see what is happening in any place in the world without leaving his own house." <br />“科学消除距离，”梅尔基亚德斯声称，“用不了多久，人们足不出户就可以看到世界上任何一个地方发生的事情。”

A burning noonday sun brought out a startling demonstration with the gigantic mangnifying glass: they put a pile of dry hay in the middle of the street and set it on fire by concentrating the sun's rays.<br />一个烈日炎炎的中午，他们用那个巨大的放大镜做了一个惊人的演示：在街道中央放置一堆干草，通过聚集太阳光将其点燃。

José Arcadio Buendía, who had still not been consoled for the failure of his magnets, conceived the idea of using that invention as a weapon of war.<br />尚未从磁铁的失败中平复的何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚，又构想了一个使用该发明作为战争武器的想法。

Again Melquíades tried to dissuade him, but he finally accepted the two magnetized ingots and three colonial coins in exchange for the magnifying glass. Úrsula wept in consternation. That money was from a chest of gold coins that her father had put together over an entire life of privation and that she had buried underneath her bed in hopes of a proper occasion to make use of it.<br />梅尔基亚德斯再次劝阻他，最后仍然接受了他使用两块磁铁和三块殖民地硬币交换放大镜。乌尔苏拉悲痛欲绝，那钱是她父亲在贫困中终其一生攒下来的一盒金币中拿出来的，她一直埋藏在床底下，希望在正确的时机好好利用它。

José Arcadio Buendía made no attempt to console her, completely absorbed in his tactical experiments with the abnegation of a scientist and even at the risk of his own life.<br />何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚没有试图去安慰她，全身心投入到他的战术实验，以科学家忘我的精神，甚至冒着生命的危险。

In an attempt to show the effects of the glass on enemy troops, he exposed himself to the concentration of the sun's rays and suffered burns which turned into sores that took a long time to heal. Over the protests of his wife, who was alarmed at such a dangerous invention, at one point he was ready to set the house on fire. <br />他试图证明放大镜对敌军的效果，将自己暴露在阳光的照射下，遭到了灼烧并溃烂成疮，很长时间才痊愈。妻子对这样危险的发明感到震惊，在她的抗议中，一度差点把房子给烧了。

He would spend hours on end in his room, calculating the strategic possibilities of his novel weapon until he succeeded in putting together a manual of startling instructional clarity and an irresistible power of conviction.<br />他待在房间的角落，计算着新式武器的战略可行性，时间一分一秒过去，凭着坚定的信念，他终于完成了一本让人一目了然的教学手册。

He sent it to the government, accompanied by numerous descriptions of his experiments and several pages of explanatory sketches, by a messenger who crossed the mountains, got lost in measureless swamps, forded stormy rivers, and was on the point of perishing under the lash of despair, plague, and wild beasts until he found a route that joined the one used by the mules that carried the mail.<br />他把研究成果邮寄给政府，附有大量的实验描述说明和几页示意图。信差翻山越岭，迷失在广袤的沼泽，蹚过湍急的河流，在绝望，瘟疫，野兽的攻击下，险些丧命，最后终于找到了一条邮件骡队使用的路线。

In spite of the fact that a trip to the capital was little less than impossible at that time, José Arcadio Buendía promised to undertake it as soon as the government ordered him to so that he could put on some practical demonstrations of his invention for the military authorities and could train them himself in the complicated art of solar war.<br />尽管当时远赴首都的可能性很小，何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚仍然承诺， 只要政府要求，他可以立即动身，为军方展示他的发明的一些实际示范，并在复杂的光学战争中训练他们。

For several years he waited for an answer. Finally, tired of waiting, he bemoaned to Melquíades the failure of his project and the gypsy then gave him a convincing proof of his honesty: he gave him back the doubloons in exchange for the magnifying glass, and he left him in addition some Portuguese maps and several instruments of navigation. <br />往后几年一直在等待回复，最终他厌倦了等待。他到梅尔基亚德斯面前哀叹他的项目失败了，于是这个吉普赛人做出了足以证明其诚实的举动：返还doubloons（西班牙古金币名），收回放大镜，还送给他一些葡萄牙地图和几个航海仪器。

In his own handwriting he set down a concise synthesis of the studies by Monk Hermann. which he left José Arcadio so that he would be able to make use of the astrolabe, the compass, and the sextant. <br />梅尔基亚德斯亲笔写下修道士Hermann的学术的简明概要，以便自己离开时，何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚能够独自使用星盘，罗盘和六分仪。

José Arcadio Buendía spent the long months of the rainy season shut up in a small room that he had built in the rear the house so that no one would disturb his experiments.<br />在漫长的雨季里，何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚把自己关在房子后面的小屋子里，不让别人打扰他的实验。

Having completely abandoned his domestic obligations, he spent entire nights in the courtyard watching the course of the stars and he almost contracted sunstroke from trying to establish an exact method to ascertain noon.<br />全然抛弃了他的家务，整夜在院子里观察星星的轨迹，为了建立一个确定中午时刻的准确方法，差点中暑。

When he became an expert in the use and manipulation of his instruments, he conceived a notion of space that allowed him to navigate across unknown seas, to visit uninhabited territories, and to establish relations with splendid beings without having to leave his study. <br />当他能够熟练操作他的仪器后，他构想了一个空间的概念。足不出户，就能航行在未知的海域，探索荒无人烟的土地，与珍禽异兽交流。

That was the period in which he acquired the habit of talking to himself, of walking through the house without paying attention to anyone, as Úrsula and the children broke their backs in the garden, growing banana and caladium, cassava and yams, ahuyama roots and eggplants.<br />那段时间他养成了自言自语的习惯，在房间里旁若无人的走来走去。乌尔苏拉和孩子们在菜园子里忙得腰酸背痛，悉心照料香蕉，芋头，木薯，山药，ahuyama roots和茄子。

Suddenly, without warning, his feverish activity was interrupted and was replaced by a kind of fascination. He spent several days as if he were bewitched, softly repeating to himself a string of fearful conjectures without giving credit to his own understanding.<br />突然，没有任何预示，他狂热的举动停止了，陷入痴迷，好几天好像着了魔似的，轻轻的重复他的可怕猜想，自己都不相信。

Finally, one Tuesday in December, at lunchtime, all at once he released the whole weight of his torment. The children would remember for the rest of their lives the august solemnity with which their father, devastated by his prolonged vigil and by the wrath of his imagination, revealed his discovery to them:<br />最终，在十二月的一个星期二，吃午饭的时候，他释放了所有的痛苦。孩子们余生都会记得被长期熬夜和头脑风暴摧残的父亲庄严肃穆的向他们宣布自己的发现：

"The earth is round, like an orange."<br />“地球是圆的，像橙子一样。”

Úrsula lost her patience. "If you have to go crazy, please go crazy all by yourself!" she shouted. "But don't try to put your gypsy ideas into the heads of the children." <br />乌尔苏拉忍无可忍，“如果你想发疯，就自个发吧！”她吼道。“但不要将吉普赛人的思想灌输到孩子们的大脑中去。”

José Arcadio Buendía, impassive, did not let himself be frightened by the desperation of his wife, who, in a seizure of rage, mashed the astrolabe against the floor.<br />她愤怒爆发，把星盘摔碎在地板上，冷漠的何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚没有被绝望的妻子惊吓住。

 He built another one, he gathered the men of the village in his little room, and he demonstrated to them, with theories that none of them could understand, the possibility of returning to where one had set out by consistently sailing east.<br />他重新做了一个星盘，他把村民聚集在他的小房间，向他们展示他们可能不能理解的理论，只要一直向东航行，就可能回到出发点。

The whole village was convinced that José Arcadio Buendía had lost his reason, when Melquíades returned to set things straight. He gave public praise to the intelligence of a man who from pure astronomical speculation had evolved a theory that had already been proved in practice, although unknown in Macondo until then, and as a proof of his admiration he made him a gift that was to have a profound influence on the future of the village: the laboratory of an alchemist.<br />整个村子的人都认为何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚已经失去了理智，当梅尔基亚德斯回来时便让事情清晰明了了。他公开赞扬了何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚的智慧，仅从纯粹的天文猜想演化成一种已经被实践证明的理论，只是至今马孔多居民都不知道。为表钦佩，梅尔基亚德斯赠送给何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚一个对这个村庄未来有深远影响的礼物：炼金术士的实验设备。

By then Melquíades had aged with surprising rapidity. On his first trips he seemed to be the same age as José Arcadio Buendía. But while the latter had preserved his extraordinary strength, which permitted him to pull down a horse by grabbing its ears, the gypsy seemed to have been worn dowse by some tenacious illness.<br />这时，梅尔基亚德斯以惊人的速度衰老。他第一次羁旅至此时，年龄与何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚相仿。他曾拥有超凡的力量，揪起马耳便能将马撂翻在地，现在这个吉普赛人似乎被一些顽疾所折磨。

It was, in reality, the result of multiple and rare diseases contracted on his innumerable trips around the world. According to what he himself said as he spoke to José Arcadio Buendía while helping him set up the laboratory, death followed him everywhere, sniffing at the cuffs of his pants, but never deciding to give him the final clutch of its claws.<br />实际上这是因为在无数次环球旅行中感染多种罕见的疾病导致的。根据他在帮助何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚建立实验室时说的，死亡紧随其后，但从未为他最后一击。

He was a fugitive from all the plagues and catastrophes that had ever lashed mankind. He had survived pellagra in Persia, scurvy in the Malayan archipelago, leprosy in Alexandria, beriberi in Japan, bubonic plague in Madagascar, an earthquake in Sicily, and a disastrous shipwreck in the Strait of Magellan.<br />他从危害人类的鼠疫和灾难中幸存了下来，在波斯得过玉米红斑病，在马来西亚群岛得过坏血病，在亚历山大得过麻风病，在日本染上脚气病，在马达加斯加得过鼠疫，在西西里岛遭遇过地震，在麦哲伦海峡遭遇过海难。

That prodigious creature, said to possess the keys of Nostradamus, was a gloomy man, enveloped in a sad aura, with an Asiatic look that seemed to know what there was on the other side of things. <br />这个坚强的男人说他知晓诺查丹玛斯（法国籍犹太裔预言家）的秘密，此人沉默阴郁，笼罩在悲伤的光环之中，一副洞悉事务另一面的亚洲人模样。

He wore a large black hat that looked like a raven with widespread wings, and a velvet vest across which the patina of the centuries had skated.<br />他戴着一顶又大又黑的帽子，宛如翅膀宽大的乌鸦，穿着丝绒背心，上面布满几个世纪的铜绿。<br /> <br />But in spite of his immense wisdom and his mysterious breadth, he had a human burden, an earthly condition that kept him involved in the small problems of daily life.<br />尽管拥有无穷的智慧和神秘的知识宽度，但毕竟是凡人之躯，被生活琐事的烦恼所困扰。

He would complain of the ailments of old age, he suffered from the most insignificant economic difficulties, and he had stopped laughing a long time back because scurvy had made his teeth drop out. <br />他抱怨年老多病，遭受了最微不足道的经济困难，他已经很久没有了笑容，因为坏血病让他牙齿掉光了。

On that suffocating noontime when the gypsy revealed his secrets, José Arcadio Buendía had the certainty that it was the beginning of a great friendship.<br />在那个闷热的中午，他透露了自己的心事。何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚坚定的认为这是他们伟大友情的开始。

The children were startled by his fantastic stories. Aureliano, who could not have been more than five at the time, would remember him for the rest of his life as he saw him that afternoon, sitting against the metallic and quivering light from the window, lighting up with his deep organ voice the darkest reaches of the imagination, while down over his temples there flowed the grease that was being melted by the heat.<br />孩子们被他奇妙的故事吓了一跳。奥雷里亚诺那是还没有五岁，他的余生都会记得见到梅尔基亚德斯的那个下午。梅尔基亚德斯坐在窗户的金属反光中，用他那深邃的管风琴般的声音点亮最黑暗的想象力，头上融化的油脂沿着太阳穴向下流淌。

José Arcadio, his older brother, would pass on that wonderful image as a hereditary memory to all of his descendants.<br />何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥，是他的哥哥，将这美好的画面通过遗传记忆传递给他的所有后人。

Úrsula on the other hand, held a bad memory of that visit, for she had entered the room just as Melquíades had carelessly broken a flask of bichloride of mercury.<br />乌尔苏拉则相反，对这次造访留下了一个坏的印象。她走进房间就看到梅尔基亚德斯不经意打碎了一个装有氯化汞的烧瓶。

"It's the smell of the devil," she said.<br />“这是魔鬼的气味，”她说。

"Not at all," Melquíades corrected her. "It has been proven that the devil has sulphuric properties and this is just a little corrosive sublimate."<br />“不是的，”梅尔基亚德斯纠正道。“你所谓的魔鬼的气味被证实含有硫酸性质，但这只是一点点腐蚀性的升华物。”

Always didactic, he went into a learned exposition of the diabolical properties of cinnabar, but Úrsula paid no attention to him, although she took the children off to pray. That biting odor would stay forever in her mind linked to the memory of Melquíades.<br />他总是好为人师，博学地解释朱砂恶魔似的特性。但是乌尔苏拉毫不在意，带着孩子们去祷告了。这种刺鼻的气味永远留在她的心中，并且和梅尔基亚德斯有关的记忆联系在一起。

The rudimentary laboratory—in addition to a profusion of pots, funnels, retorts, filters, and sieves—was made up of a primitive water pipe, a glass beaker with a long, thin neck, a reproduction of the philosopher's egg, and a still the gypsies themselves had built in accordance with modern descriptions of the three-armed alembic of Mary the Jew.<br />这间简陋的实验室——除了大量的锅，漏斗，曲颈瓶，过滤器和原始水管组成的筛子，颈部细长的玻璃烧杯，"哲学家之卵"的复制品，还有吉普赛人自己按照现代描述制作的玛丽亚犹太人的三臂蒸馏器。

Along with those items, Melquíades left samples, the formulars of the seven metals that corresponded to the seven planets, the formulas of Moses and Zosimus for doubling the quantity of gold, and a set of notes and sketches concerning the processes of the Great Teaching that would permit  those who could interpret them to undertake the manufacture of the philosopher's stone.<br />除此之外，梅尔基亚德斯还留下了与七大行星相对应的金属的配方的样本，Moses和Zosimus的双倍黄金配方，以及一套关于伟大教学过程的笔记和素描草图，如果谁能将其阐述清楚，他就能制造出“哲学之石”（即黄金）。

Seduced by the simplicity of the formulas to double the quantity of gold, José Arcadio Buendía paid court to Úrsula for several weeks so that she would let him dig up her colonial coins and increase them by as many times as it was possible to subdivide mercury.<br />何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚被双倍黄金的简单公式吸引，他缠着乌尔苏拉好几个星期，就是为了让她挖出殖民地金币，通过多次细分汞，试图让金子成倍增长。

 Úrsula gave in, as always, to her husband's unyielding obstinacy. Then José Arcadio Buendía threw three doubloons into a pan and fused them with copper filings, orpiment, brimstone, and lead. He put it all to boil in a pot of castor oil unitl he got a thick and pestilential syrup which was more like common caramel than valuable gold.<br />乌尔苏拉总是屈服于丈夫不屈不挠的犟脾气。何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚将三十枚多普隆金币投入坩锅中，与铜屑，雄黄，硫磺和铅熔化在一起。将它们倒入一锅蓖麻油中，得到一种瘟疫般的浓浆，相较于有价值的黄金，更像普通的焦糖。<br /> <br />In risky and desperate processes of distillation, melted with the seven planetary metals, mixed with hermetic mercury and vitriol of Cyprus, and put back to cook in hog fat for lack of any radish oil, Úrsula's precious inheritance was reduced to a large of burnt hog cracklings that was firmly stuck to the bottom of the pot.<br />在危险和绝望的蒸馏过程中，与七种行星金属相融合，与密封着的汞和塞浦路斯的硫酸相混合，因为缺少胡萝卜油，又把它放入猪油中熬制。乌尔苏拉珍贵的遗产变为烧焦的油渣，牢牢地黏在锅底。

When the gypsies came back, Úrsula had turned the whole population of the village against them. But curiosity was greater that fear, for that time the pypsies went about the town making a deafening noise with all manner of musical instruments while a hawker announced the exhibition of the most fabulous discovery of the Naciancenes.<br />当吉普赛人又来了的时候，乌尔苏拉发动全村的人抵制他们。但好奇心大于恐惧，这次吉普赛人用各种乐器在镇上发出震耳欲聋的声音，一个小贩宣称要展示纳齐安内斯人最绝妙的发明。

So that everyone went to tent and by paying one cent they saw a youthful Melquíades, recovered, unwrinkled, with a new and flashing set of teeth.<br />每个人都去帐篷，付上一分钱，看到了一个年轻的梅尔基亚德斯，他恢复了健康，皱纹消失了，一副新的洁白光亮的牙齿。

Those who remembered his gums that had been destroyed by scurvy, his flaccid cheeks, and his withered lips trembled with fear at the final proof of the gypsy's supernatural power. <br />记得曾经他那被坏血病摧毁的齿龈，松弛的脸颊，干枯的嘴唇的人颤抖而恐惧，最终成为吉普赛人拥有超自然力量的证据。

The fear turned into panic when Melquíades took out his teeth, intact, encased in their gums, and showed them to the audience for an instant——a fleeting instant in which he went back to being the same decrepit man of years past——and put them back again and smiled once more with the full control of his restored youth.<br />梅尔基亚德斯拿出他的牙齿，完整无缺，被牙龈包裹，并马上展示给观众看，恐惧变成了恐慌。瞬间他变回了以前衰老的样子。然后放回口腔，微笑中再次回到了年轻的模样。

Even José Arcadio Buendía himself considered that Melquíades' knowledge had reached unbearable extremes, but he felt a healthy excitement when the gypsy explained to him alone the workings of his false teeth.<br />甚至何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚自己都认为梅尔基亚德斯的知识到达了不可企及的高度，但是当梅尔基亚德斯跟他解释假牙的工作原理时，他又感到一种兴奋。

It seemed so simple and so prodigious at the same time that overnight he lost all interest in his experiments in alchemy. He underwent a new crisis of bad humor.<br />这似乎非常简单，同时又如此的惊人，一夜之间，他对炼金术的实验失去了兴趣。他经历了一场新的情绪危机。

He did not go back to eating regularly, and he would spend the day walking through the house. "Incredible things are happening in the world," he said to Úrsula. "Right there across the river there are all kinds of magical instruments while we keep on living like donkeys."<br />他经常不回去吃饭，整天在房间里走来走去。“世界上正在发生难以置信的事，”他对乌尔苏拉说，“就在河的那边，有各种各样魔法仪器，而我们缺像蠢驴一样活着”。

Those who had known him since the foundation of Macondo were startled at how much he had changed under  Melquíades' influence.<br />从马孔多建立时就了解他的人，都惊讶于他在梅尔基亚德斯的影响下发生的变化。

At first Jose Arcadio Buendía had been a kind of youthful patriarch who would give instructions for planting and advice for the raising of children and animals, and who collaborated with everyone, even in the physical work, for the welfare of the community.<br />当初何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚是一位年轻的族长，时常给大家提供种植，照料小孩和家畜的一些建议，与所有人合作，甚至为社区的福利亲力亲为。

Since his house from the very first had been the best in the village, the others had been built in its image and likeness.<br />因为他家的房子是全村庄最好的，其他人都按照他家的样式建造房子。

It had a small, well-lighted living roost, a dining room in the shape of a terrace gaily colored flowers, two bedrooms, a courtyard with a gigantic chestnut tree, a well kept garden, and a corral where goats, pigs, and hens lived in peaceful communion. The only animals that were prohibited, not just in his house but in the entire settlement, were fighting cocks.<br />他家有一个光线充足的小居所，一个露台形状的餐厅，摆满鲜艳的花卉，两个卧室，一个种着一棵高大板栗树的庭院，一个照料得很好的花园，一个山羊、猪、母鸡和平共处的畜栏。公鸡是唯一被禁止的动物，不仅在他家，全村都禁止斗鸡。（第二章中何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚在斗鸡场杀死了普鲁登西奥·阿吉拉尔，鬼魂在他家游荡，让他饱受精神折磨，这也是他们翻山越岭搬到此处的原因）

Úrsula's capacity for work was the same as that of her husband. Active, small, severe, that woman of unbreakable nerves who at no moment in her life had been heard to sing seemed to be everywhere, from dawn until quite late at night, always pursued by the soft whispering stiff, starched petticoats. Thanks to her the floors of tamped earth, the unwhitewashed mud walls, the rustic, wooden furniture they had built themselves were always clean, and the old chests where they kept their clothes exhaled the warm smell of basil.<br />乌尔苏拉的工作能力像他的丈夫一样，她是一个活跃，娇小，严厉，意志坚强的女人。在她的生活中无论何时何地似乎都没有听她唱过歌。从黎明到深夜，总是被僵硬的衬裙的沙沙声驱使（裙子硬了就需要洗了？），多亏了她，夯土上的地板，还未粉刷的泥墙，质朴的自制木质家具，总是干干净净，装衣服的旧箱子散发着温暖的罗勒（紫苏科植物）气味。

José Arcadio Buendía, who was the most enterprising man ever to be seen in the village, had set up the placement of the houses in such a way that from all of them one could reach the river and draw water with the same effort, and he had lined up the streets with such good sense that no house got more sun than another during the hot time of day.<br />何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚是全村最有进取心的男人。规划房屋的建造地址，保证每家每户到河边取水都同样的方便，规划街道的布局，保证在最热的时候，每家每户拥有相同的阳光。

Within a few years Macondo was a village that was more orderly and hard working than any known until then by its three hundred inhabitants. It was a truly happy village where no one was over thirty years of age and where no one had died.<br />几年之内，马孔多变成了一个比任何地方都有秩序，人们勤奋工作的村庄，那时已经有三百个居民了，这是一个真正幸福的村庄，没有人超过三十岁，也还没有人去世。

Since the time of its founding, José Arcadio Buendía had built traps and cages. In a short time he filled not only his own house but all of those in the village with troupials, canaries, bee eaters, and redbreasts. The concert of so many different birds became so disturbing that Úrsula would plug her ears with beeswax so as not to lose her sense of reality.<br />自建村以来，何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚就开始制作陷阱和笼子，不久，他家以及全村养起了拟黄鹂，金丝雀，蜂虎鸟和知更鸟。许多不同种类的鸟叽叽喳喳像开音乐会一样，让人心神不安。乌尔苏拉把蜂蜡塞到耳朵里，以免自己丧失现实感。

The first time that Melquíades' tribe arrived, selling glass balls for headaches, everyone was surprised that they had been able to find that village lost in the drowsiness of the swamp, and the gypsies confessed that they had found their way by the song of the birds.<br />梅尔基亚德斯的部落第一次来这售卖医治头痛用的玻璃球的时候，大家都很诧异他们是怎么找到这个村庄的。吉普赛人承认他们迷失在沼泽的困倦中，因为鸟鸣声才找到这里。

That spirit of social initiative disappeared in a short time, pulled away by the fever of the magnets, the astronomical calculations, the dreams transmutation, the urge to discover the wonders of the world.<br />何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚的这种造福社会的主动性很快就消失了，痴迷上了磁铁，天文计算，梦想转变为探索世界的奇迹。

From a clean and active man, José Arcadio Buendía changed into a man lazy in appearance, careless in his dress, with a wild beard that Úrsula managed to trim great effort and a kitchen knife.<br />何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚从一个衣着整洁，精力充沛变成了一个外表懒散，穿着草率的男人，满脸的胡须让乌尔苏拉用一把厨房菜刀废了很大功夫才修剪干净。

There were many who considered him the victim of some strange spell. But even those most convinced of his madness left work family to follow him when he brought out his tools to clear the land and asked the assembled group to open a way that would put Macondo in contact with the great inventions.<br />许多人认为他是受到了某些咒语的迫害。但是当他带着工具去清理土地，要求集合小组去开辟道路，以便让马孔多与伟大发明联系起来的时候，即使深信他已经发疯了的人们也会放弃工作和家庭跟随他。

José Arcadio Buendía was completely ignorant of the geography of the region. He knew that to the east there lay an impenetrable mountain chain and that on the other side of the mountains there was the ardent city of Riohacha, where in times past-according to what he had been told by the first Aureliano Buendía, his grandfather-Sir Francis Drake had gone crocodile hunting with cannons and that he repaired hem and stuffed them with straw to bring to Queen Elizabeth.<br />何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚完全不了解这个地区的地理环境。他知道东边有一条难以穿越的山脉，在山的另一面有一个热闹的Riohacha市。以前，根据他的祖父，即第一代奥雷里亚诺·布恩迪亚所说，弗朗西斯·德雷克爵士用大炮狩猎鳄鱼，并用稻草填充修复，带给伊丽莎白女王。

In his youth, José Arcadio Buendía and his men, with wives and children, animals and all kinds of domestic implements, had crossed the mountains in search of an outlet to the sea, and after twenty-six months they gave up the expedition and founded Macondo, so they would not have to go back.<br />年轻的时候，何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚和其他人一起，带着妻儿，家畜和各种器物，翻越山脉，搜寻前往大海的出路。二十六个月后，他们放弃了探险，原地建立了马孔多，这样他们就不必走回头路了。

It was, therefore, a route that did not interest him, for it could lead only to the past. To the south lay the swamps, covered with an eternal vegetable scum and the whole vast universe of the great swamp, which, according to what the gypsies said, had no limits.<br />因此东部这条路线对他们没有什么意义了，再走下去可能会重蹈覆辙。南部布满了沼泽，上面铺满了没完没了的植物浮沫，据吉普赛人所说，这片广阔的沼泽地无边无际。

The great swamp in the west mingled a boundless extension of water where there were soft-skinned cetaceans that had the head and torso of a woman, causing the ruination of sailors with the charm of their extraordinary breasts.<br />西部的大沼泽混合着无边的水域，水中有一种皮肤柔软的鲸鱼，有着女人的头和躯体（美人鱼？），非凡的胸部诱惑力导致了水手们的毁灭。

The gypsies sailed along that route for six months before they reached the strip of land over which the mules that carried the mail passed.<br />吉普赛人沿着这条路线航行了六个月，才到达了载着邮件的骡子经过的地带。

According to José Arcadio Buendía's calculations, the only possibility contact with civilization lay along the northern route. So he handed out clearing tools and hunting weapons to the same men who had been with him during the founding of Macondo. He threw his directional instruments and his maps into a knapsack, and he undertook the reckless adventure.<br />根据何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚的计算，唯一可能与文明联系的是北部路线。因此他把清理工具和狩猎武器发放给和他一起建立马孔多的那批人，他把方仪器和地图扔进背包，开始了不顾一切的大胆开拓。

During the first days they did not come across any appreciable obstacle. They went down along the stony bank of the river to the place where years before they had found the soldier's armor, and from there they went into the woods along a path between wild orange trees.<br />第一天他们遇到任何明显的障碍，他们沿着布满石头的河岸走到之前找到士兵盔甲的地方，然后经过一条两旁长着野生橙子树的小径进入树林。

At the end of the first week they killed and roasted a deer, but they agreed to eat only half of it and salt the rest for the days that lay ahead. With that precaution they tried to postpone the necessity of having to eat macaws, whose blue flesh had a harsh and musky taste.<br />第一周结束，他们烤了一头鹿，但是他们决定只吃掉一半，腌制另一半，用来应对后面的日子。这个预防措施可以让他们推迟吃金刚鹦鹉，因为它的肉具有刺激性和麝香味。

Then, for more than ten days, they did not see the sun again. The ground became soft and damp, like volcanic ash, and the vegetation was thicker and thicker, and the cries of the birds and the uproar of the monkeys became more more remote, and the world became eternally sad.<br />接下来的十多天，他们再也没有看到过阳光，地面变得柔软潮湿，像火山灰，植被越来越厚，鸟鸣声和猴子的喧闹越来越遥远，世界变得越来越凄凉。

The men on the expedition felt overwhelmed by their most ancient memories in that paradise of dampness and silence, going back to before original sin, as their boots sank into pools of steaming oil and their machetes destroyed bloody lilies and golden salamanders.<br />潮湿又寂静的天堂，最古老的记忆让探险队的人们被不堪重负，回到原罪之前？？？，他们的靴子陷入热气腾腾的油汽池中，砍刀一路摧毁血腥的百合花和金色的蝾螈。

For a week, almost without speaking, they went ahead like sleepwalkers through a universe of grief, lighted only by the tenuous reflection of luminous insects, and their lungs were overwhelmed by a suffocating smell of blood.<br />整整花了一个星期，他们之间几乎没有说过话，像梦游者一样走过这个悲伤的世界。路上唯一的光源来自发光昆虫微弱的光影，他们的肺部充满了血腥的气味。

They could not return because the strip that they were opening as they went along would soon close up with a new vegetation that. almost seemed to grow before their eyes. "It's all right," José Arcadio Buendía would say. "The main thing is not to lose our bearings."<br />他们无法返回，因为他们新开辟的地带，刚离开，很快就被植被覆盖掉了，几乎在眼前就长起来了。“没关系，”何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚说。“最重要的事情是不要迷失我们的方向。”

Always following his compass, he kept on guiding his men toward the invisible north so that they would be able to get out of that enchanted region. It was a thick night, starless, but the darkness was becoming impregnated with a fresh and clear air.<br />跟随着罗盘的方向，他带领着跟随他的人一直往看不见的北方前进，这样他们才能走出这令人着魔的地区。这是一个伸手不见五指的夜晚，没有星星，但是黑暗中遍布清新干净的空气。

Exhausted by the long crossing, they hung up their hammocks and slept deeply for the first time in two weeks. When they woke up, with the sun already high in the sky, they were speechless with fascination.<br />长途跋涉让他们精疲力竭，他们挂起吊床，两个星期以来第一次睡得这么熟。当他们醒来时，太阳已在空中高悬，眼前的景象让他们着迷，惊讶的说不话来。

Before them, surrounded by ferns and palm trees, white and powdery in the silent morning light, was an enormous Spanish galleon.<br />在他们面前，环绕着蕨类植物和棕榈树，在寂静的晨曦中，白色的满是灰尘的是一个巨大的西班牙帆船。

Tilted slightly to the starboard, it had hanging from its intact masts the dirty rags of its sails in the midst of its rigging, which was adorned with orchids.<br />右舷略微倾斜，完整的桅杆悬挂着脏布帆，绳索中间，兰花装饰其间。

The hull, covered with an armor of petrified barnacles and soft moss, was firmly fastened into a surface stones. The whole structure seemed to occupy its own space, one of solitude and oblivion, protected from the vices of time and the habits of the birds.<br />船体覆盖着一层石化的藤壶和柔软的苔藓，被牢牢地固定在一块石头上面。整个结构占据的空间，属于孤独和遗忘的一角，免受了时间的束缚和鸟类的骚扰。

Inside, where the expeditionaries explored with careful intent, there was nothing but a thick forest of flowers.<br />远征者们仔细探索船体内部，什么都没有发现，除了一片茂密的花丛。

The discovery of the galleon, an indication of the proximity of the sea, broke José Arcadio Buendía's drive. He considered it a trick of his whimsical fate to have searched for the sea without finding it, at the cost of countless sacrifices and suffering, and to have found it all of a sudden without looking for it, as if it lay across his path like an insurmountable object.<br />帆船的发现，表明大海就在附近，何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚的激情深受打击。他认为这是自己滑稽命运设置的一个骗局，以无数的牺牲和痛苦为代价寻找大海却没有找到，现在无意寻找，却又发现了它，像是一个不可逾越的物体横跨在他前进的道路上。

Many years later Colonel Aureliano Buendía crossed the region again, when it was already a regular mail route, and the only part of the ship he found was its burned-out frame in the midst of a field of poppies.<br />许多年以后，奥雷里亚诺·布恩迪亚上校穿过这块区域，这里已经是一条往来频繁的驿道。他发现那只帆船唯一剩下的部分是在罂粟地中间已经烧毁的框架。

Only then, convinced that the story had not been some product of his father's imagination, did he wonder how the galleon had been able to get inland to that spot.<br />那时他才相信父亲讲述的故事并不是他想象出来的，并且好奇这个帆船是如何到达内陆的。

But José Arcadio Buendía did not concern himself with that when he found the sea after another four days' journey from the galleon. His dreams ended as he faced that ashen, foamy, dirty sea, which had not merited the risks and sacrifices of the adventure.<br />但是何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚没有关心这个问题。经过帆船，接连走了四天的路程，他终于发现了大海。他的梦想结束了，面对这灰白色，充满泡沫，肮脏的大海，根本不值得为之冒险和牺牲。

"God damn it!" he shouted. "Macondo is surrounded by water on all sides."<br />“该死的！”他吼道，“马孔多四周都是水。”

The idea of a peninsular Macondo prevailed for a long time, inspired by the arbitrary map that José Arcadio Buendía sketched on his return from the expedition.<br />马孔多是一个半岛的思想盛行了很长一段时间，这源于何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚探险回来后随意画的地图。

He drew it in rage, evilly, exaggerating the difficulties communication, as if to punish himself for the absolute lack of sense with which he had chosen the place.<br />他绘图时满怀愤怒，邪念，夸大了交通的艰难。好像要惩罚自己如此的缺乏意识才会选择这个地方。

"We'll never get anywhere," he lamented to Úrsula. "We're going to rot our lives away here without receiving the benefits of science." That certainty, mulled over for several months in the small room he used as his laboratory, brought him to the conception of the plan to move Maeondo to a better place.<br />“我们那也去不来了，”他哀叹着跟乌尔苏拉说，“我们的生命将会腐烂在这里，得不到科学带来的好处。”可以肯定的是，他在实验室仔细研究了几个月，产生了一个计划将马孔多搬到一个更好的地方去的构想。

But that time Úrsula had anticipated his feverish designs. With the secret and implacable labor of a small ant she predisposed the women of the village against the flightiness of their husbands, who were already preparing for the move.<br />但是那时乌尔苏拉已经预料到了丈夫的疯狂计划。她秘密的，蚂蚁般不屈不饶的，发动村里的女人们抵抗已经开始准备搬家的丈夫们的疯狂举动。

José Arcadio Buendía did not know at what moment or because of what adverse forces his plan had become enveloped in a web of pretexts, disappointments, and evasions until it turned into nothing but an illusion.<br />何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚不知道什么时候或者什么不利的原因迫使他的计划被笼罩在一系列的借口、失望和逃避之中，最终变成一种幻觉。

Úrsula watched him with innocent attention and even felt some pity for him on the morning when she found him in the back room muttering about his plans for moving as he placed his laboratory pieces in their original boxes.<br />乌尔苏拉无辜地看着他，早上她发现何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚在后面的房间里喃喃自语，准备将他实验室里的器材装进原来的箱子里，甚至对他产生了一些怜悯。

She let him finish. She let him nail up the boxes and put his initials on them with an inked brush, without reproaching him, but knowing now that he knew (because she had heard him say so in his soft monologues) that the men of the village would not back him up in his undertaking.<br />她让他做完，让他钉好箱子，用墨笔签上他的名字首字母，没有责骂他。乌尔苏拉确信他知道村里的男人们不会支持他的事业（因为乌尔苏拉在他的自言自语中听他说过）。

Only when he began to take down the door of the room did Úrsula dare ask him what he was doing, and he answered with a certain bitterness. "Since no one wants to leave, we'll leave all by ourselves." Úrsula did not become upset.<br />只有当他开始取下房间的门时，乌尔苏拉才敢问他在做什么，他回答的有些苦涩，“既然没人想离开，那我们自己走。”乌尔苏拉并没有生气。

"We will not leave," she said. "We will stay here, because we have had a son here."<br />“我们不会离开的，”她说。“我们就呆在这，因为我们在这生了一个孩子。”

"We have still not had a death," he said. "A person does not belong to a place until there is someone dead under the ground."<br />“我们还没有死人，”他说，“只要没有死人埋在这里，就不属于这个地方。”

Úrsula replied with a soft firmness:<br />苏尔苏拉温柔而坚定地回答：

"If I have to die for the rest of you to stay here, I will die."<br />“如果我死了能让你留在这里，那我现在就去死。”

José Arcadio Buendía had not thought that his wife's will was so firm. He tried to seduce her with the charm of his fantasy, with the promise of a prodigious world where all one had to do was sprinkle some magic liquid on the ground and the plants would bear fruit whenever a man wished, and where all manner of instruments against pain were sold at bargain prices.<br />何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚没有想到他的妻子如此的坚定。他试图用幻想的魅力诱惑她，承诺带她到一个神奇的世界，人们只需在地上洒上一些神奇的液体，植物就能按照人们的意愿长出果实。各种治疗头痛的器械以低价出售。

But Úrsula was insensible to his clairvoyance.<br />乌尔苏拉对他的未卜先知不为所动。

"Instead of going around thinking about your crazy inventions, you should be worrying about your sons," she replied. "look at the state they're in, running wild just like donkeys."<br />“你应该担心你的孩子，而不是思考你疯狂的发明，”她说，“看看他们现在的样子，就像驴一样四处狂奔。”

José Arcadio Buendía took his wife's words literally. He looked out the window and saw the barefoot children in the sunny garden and he had the impression that only at that instant had they begun to exist, conceived by Úrsula's spell.<br />何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚接受了妻子的话，他看着窗外，看着阳光灿烂的花园里光着赤脚的孩子们。他感觉那一瞬间他们才开始出现，这种感觉从乌尔苏拉的咒语中浮现。

Something occurred inside of him then, something mysterious and definitive that uprooted him from his own time and carried him adrift through an unexplored region of his memory.<br />他的内心发生了某些变化，一种神秘而又坚定的力量把他从自己的世界里连根铲除，把他带向从未涉足的记忆中。

While Úrsula continued sweeping the house, which was safe now from being abandoned for the rest of her life, he stood there with an absorbed look, contemplating the children unitl his eyes became moist and he dried them with the back of his hand, exhaling a deep sigh of resignation.<br />乌尔苏拉继续打扫着房子，相信余生将继续生活在这里。他全神贯注地站在那里注视着他的孩子们，直到眼睛湿润。他用手背擦干双眼，接受了现实，并深深地叹了一口气。

"All right," he said. "Tell them to come help me take the things out of the boxes."<br />“好吧，”他说，“叫孩子们来帮我把东西从箱子里拿出来吧。”

José Arcadio, the older of the children, was fourteen. He had a square head, thick hair, and his father's character. Although he had the same impulse for growth and physical strength, it was early evident that he lacked imagination.<br />大儿子何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥十四岁了，国字脸，浓密的头发，有着父亲一样的性格。发育迅速，体格健壮，然而他显然缺乏想象力。

He had been conceived and born during the difficult crossing of the mountains, before the founding of Macondo, and his parents gave thanks to heaven when they saw he had no animal features.<br />在马孔多建立之前的穿越山脉的艰难时期，孕育并诞生了何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥。当看到他没有动物的特征（猪尾巴，后面会提及），他的父母感谢上帝。

Aureliano, the first human being to be born in Macondo, would be six years old in March. He was silent and withdrawn. He had wept in his mother's womb and had been born with his eyes open.<br />奥雷里亚诺，是第一个在马孔多出生的人，三月份他就要满六岁了。他沉默内向，曾在母亲的子宫里哭泣，出生时睁着眼睛。

As they were cutting the umbilical cord, he moved his head from side to side, taking in the things in the room examining the faces of the people with a fearless curiosity.<br />剪断脐带的时候，他把头从一侧转向另一侧，看着房间里的东西，以无畏的好奇心观察人们的脸庞。

Then, indifferent to those who came close to look at him, he kept his attention concentrated on the palm roof, which looked as if it were about to collapse under the tremendous pressure of the rain.<br />然后对凑近看他的人漠不关心，他把注意力集中在棕榈屋顶，在雨的巨大压力下看起来好像要塌掉一样。

Úrsula did not remember the intensity of that look again until one day when little Aureliano, at the age of three, went into the kitchen at the moment she was taking a pot of boiling soup from the stove and putting it on the table.<br />乌尔苏拉不记得那种紧张的表情，直到有一天，三岁的小奥雷里亚诺走进厨房，此刻她炉子上取下一锅沸腾的汤放在桌子上。

The child, Perplexed, said from the doorway, "It's going to spill." The pot was firmly placed in the center of the table, but just as soon as the child made his announcement, it began an unmistakable movement toward the edge, as if impelled by some inner dynamism, and it fell and broke on the floor.<br />小奥雷里亚诺站在门口，一脸困惑地说，“要掉下来了。”这锅稳稳当当的放在桌子中间，但就在孩子刚说完，仿佛被一股内力驱使，它开始向桌子边缘移动，随即掉下桌子，摔碎在地板上。

Úrsula, alarmed, told her husband about the episode, but he interpreted it as a natural phenomenon. That was the way he always was alien to the existence of his sons, partly because he considered childhood as a period of mental insufficiency, and partly because he was always too absorbed in his fantastic speculations.<br />乌尔苏拉惊慌地把这段经历告诉丈夫，但是他认为这只是一种自然现象。对于儿子们的存在，他总是感到陌生。部分原因是他认为童年时期孩子的智力尚未发育完全，部分原因是他总是过于专注在自己的奇妙猜想上。

But since the afternoon when he called the children in to help him unpack the things in the laboratory, he gave them his best hours.<br />但是自从那个下午，在实验室他让孩子们帮他打开实验仪器，他把最好的时光给了他们。

In the small separate room, where the walls were gradually being covered by strange maps and fabulous drawings, he taught them to read and write and do sums, and he spoke to them about the wonders of the world, not only where his learning had extended, but forcing the limits of his imagination to extremes.<br />在这个独立的小房子里，墙壁逐渐被奇特的地图和绝妙的图画覆盖，他教孩子们读书、写字、计算，告诉他们有关世界的奇妙，不仅有他学习延伸所到之处，还有他想象力推向极致之处。

It was in that way that the boys ended up learning that in the southern extremes of Africa there were men so intelligent and peaceful that their only pastime was to sit and think, and that it was possible to cross the Aegean Sea on foot by jumping from island to island all the way to the port of Salonika.<br />就这样，小男孩们学习到了在非洲最南端，那里的人聪明且平和，他们唯一的消遣就是坐下来思考。可以步行穿过爱情海，从一个岛跳到另一个岛，最终就可以到达萨洛尼卡港口。

Those hallucinating sessions remained printed on the memories of the boys in such a way that many years later, a second before the regular army officer gave the firing squad the command to fire, Colonel Aureliano Buendía saw once more that warm March afternoon on which his father had interrupted the lesson in physics and stood fascinated, with his hand in the air and his eyes motionless, listening to the distant pipes, drums, and jingles of the gypsies, who were coming to the village once more, announcing the latest and most startling discovery of the sages of Memphis.<br />这段浮想以这种方式留在了男孩们的记忆里，许多年以后，在政府军军官命令行刑队开枪的前一刻，奥雷里亚诺·布恩迪亚上校又一次想起了三月里那个温暖的下午，父亲中断了物理课，站在那入了迷，手停在空中，眼神静止，倾听远处吉普赛人的笛声，鼓声，叮当声。他们再次来到村庄，推销孟菲斯市智者的最新的惊人发明。

They were new gypsies, young men and women who knew only their own language, handsome specimens with oily skins and intelligent hands, whose dances and music sowed a panic of uproarious joy through the streets, with parrots painted all colors reciting Italian arias, and a hen who laid a hundred golden eggs to the sound of a tambourine, and a trained monkey who read minds, and the multi-use machine that could be used at the same time to sew on buttons and reduce fevers, the apparatus to make a person forget his bad memories, and a poultice to lose time, and a thousand more inventions so ingenious and unusual that José Arcadio Buendía must have wanted to invent a memory machine so that he could remember them all.<br />这是一群新来的吉普赛人，年轻的男男女女，只懂他们自己的语言，英俊的样子，油亮的皮肤，灵巧的双手。他们载歌载舞地经过街道，引起一阵喧闹的欢乐，他们带着绘制各种颜色的鹦鹉，吟唱意大利的咏叹调，一只母鸡在鼓声中下了一百个金蛋，一只受过训练的猴子能读懂人的心思，多用途的机器既能缝扣子又能退烧？？？，能让人忘掉悲伤记忆的仪器，能让人忘记时间的膏药等一千多种精巧罕见的发明。何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚非常的想发明一种记忆机器来记录这一切。

In an instant they transformed the village. The inhabitants of Macondo found themselves lost is their own streets, confused by the crowded fair.<br />瞬间他们改变了村庄，马孔多的居民在街上迷失了自己，困在了拥挤的集市。

Holding a child by each hand so as not to lose them in the tumult, bumping into acrobats with gold-capped teeth and jugglers with six arms, suffocated by the mingled breath of manure and sandals that the crowd exhaled, José Arcadio Buendía went about everywhere like a madman, looking for Melquíades so that he could reveal to him the infinite secrets of that fabulous nightmare.<br />何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚一手抓住一个孩子，以免他们在骚动中走失，不小心碰到镶着金牙的杂技演员和六条胳膊的杂耍艺人，粪便味和人群中散发的檀香味的混合气味让他窒息，他发疯似的各处寻找梅尔基亚德斯，让他解释这神奇梦魇的无穷奥秘。

He asked several gypsies, who did not understand his language. Finally he reached the place where Melquíades used to set up his tent and he found a taciturn Armenian who in Spanish was hawking a syrup to make oneself invisible.<br />他询问了许多吉普赛人，没人能听懂他的语言。最后他来到梅尔基亚德斯曾经搭建帐篷的地方，找到一个沉默寡言的亚美尼亚人，他正用西班牙语兜售一瓶喝了能让人隐身的糖浆。

He had drunk down a glass of the amber substance in one gulp as José Arcadio Buendía elbowed his way through the absorbed group that was witnessing the spectacle, and was able to ask his question.<br />那人一口气喝下一杯琥珀色的物质，此时，何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚用手拨开收看精彩表演的拥挤人群，向他询问问题。

The gypsy wrapped him in the frightful climate of his look before he turned into a puddle of pestilential and smoking pitch over which the echo of his reply still floated: "Melquíades is dead."<br />他看到那人被一股糟糕的气体包围，随即变成了一洼冒着烟的瘟疫水坑，他的回答仍在空中回响：“梅尔基亚德斯已经死了。”

Upset by the news, José Arcadio Buendía stood motionless, trying to rise above his affliction, until the group dispersed, called away by other artifices, and the puddle of the taciturn Armenian evaporated completely.<br />听到这个消息，何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚沮丧极了，一动不动，努力抑制自己的悲痛，直到人群被其他技巧吸引，逐渐疏散，沉默寡言的亚美尼亚人变成的水坑也全部蒸发完了。

Other gypsies confirmed later on that Melquíades had in fact succumbed to the fever on the beach at Singapore and that his body had been thrown into the deepest part of the Java Sea.<br />其他的吉普赛人后来确认梅尔基亚德斯殒命于新加坡海滩上的发烧，他的尸体被抛进了爪哇海的最深处。

The children had no interest in the news. They insisted that their father take them to see the overwhelming novelty of the sages of Memphis that was being advertised at the entrance of a tent that, according to what was said, had belonged to King Solomon.<br />孩子们对这个新闻并没有兴趣，他们坚持让父亲带他们去看孟菲斯市智者的新奇发明。根据帐篷入口的广告上所说，这个发明属于所罗门之王。

They insisted so much that José Arcadio Buendía paid the thirty reales and led them into the center of the tent, where there was a giant with a hairy torso and a shaved head, with a copper ring in his nose and a heavy iron chain on his ankle, watching over a pirate chest. When it was opened by the giant, the chest gave off a glacial exhalation.<br />孩子们坚持让父亲付了三十个reales，带他们来到帐篷中心，有一个身体毛茸茸的光头巨人，鼻子上扣了一个铜环，一条沉重的铁链锁在脚踝上，看守着一个海盗箱子。当巨人打开箱子时，里面散发出冰冷的寒气。

Inside there was only an enormous, transparent block with infinite internal needles in which the light of the sunset was broken up into colored stars. Disconcerted, knowing that the children were waiting for an immediate explanation, José Arcadio Buendía ventured a murmur:<br />箱中只有一个巨大的透明块，里面有无数的针状物，夕阳被分裂成彩色的星星。何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚尴尬不安，知道孩子们正等待他的解释，他谨慎地嘀咕了一句：

"It's the largest diamond in the world."<br />“这是世界上最大的钻石。”

"No," the gypsy countered. "It's ice."<br />“不，”吉普赛人反驳道。“这是冰。”

José Arcadio Buendía, without understanding, stretched out his hand toward the cake, but the giant moved it away. "Five reales more to touch it," he said.<br />何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚并没有理解，他向这个东西伸出手去，却被巨人推开了，“至少五个reales才能触摸，”巨人说道。

José Arcadio Buendía paid them and put his hand on the ice and held it there for several minutes as his heart filled with fear and jubilation at the contact with mystery.<br />何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚付了钱，把自己的手放在冰块上好几分钟，心中充满了接触神秘的畏惧和喜悦。

Without knowing what to say, he paid ten reales more so that his sons could have that prodigious experience.<br />不知道如何表达这种感受，于是他再付了10个reales，让他的两个儿子也能体会这种惊人的经历。

Little José Arcadio refused to touch it. Aureliano, on the other hand, took a step forward and put his hand on it, withdrawing it immediately.<br />小何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥（大儿子）拒绝触摸冰块，相反，奥雷里亚诺（小儿子）向前迈了一步，把手放在上面，又迅速地撤回了。

"It's boiling," he exclaimed, startled. But his father paid no attention to him. Intoxicated by the evidence of the miracle, he forgot at that moment about the frustration of his delirious undertakings Melquíades' body, abandoned to the appetite of the squids.<br />“它在沸腾，”他惊讶地说。但是他的父亲并没有在意他，而是陶醉于这个奇迹的物证。在那一刻，他忘记了疯狂事业带来的挫折，忘记了被枪乌贼吃掉的梅尔基亚德斯。

He paid another five reales and with his hand on the cake, as if giving testimony on the holy scriptures, he exclaimed:<br />他又另付了五个reales，把手放在冰块上，就像手持圣经出庭作证一样庄重，惊呼道：

"This is the great invention of our time."<br />“这是我们时代的伟大发明。”
