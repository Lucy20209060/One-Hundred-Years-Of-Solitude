# Chapter 2

When the pirate Sir Francis Drake attacked Riohacha in the sixteenth century, Úrsula Iguarán's great-great-grandmother became so frightened with the ringing of alarm bells and the firing of cannons that she lost control of her nerves and sat down on a lighted stove. The burns changed her into a useless wife for the rest of her days.  <br />当海盗弗朗西斯·德雷克爵士在十六世纪攻打奥阿查（位于哥伦比亚地区）时，乌尔苏拉·伊瓜兰的曾曾祖母受到了响亮的警报钟声和大炮的开火声的惊吓，神经失去控制，一下坐在了燃烧着的火炉上，烧伤使其余生都不能尽妻子之职。

She could only sit on one side, cushioned by pillows, and something strange must have happened to her way of walking, for she never walked again in public.<br />她只能侧坐着，垫着坐垫，走路的方式也变得很奇怪，所以她再也没有在公共场合走过路。

She gave up all kinds of social activity, obsessed with the notion that her body gave off a singed odor. <br />她放弃了所有的社交活动，固执认为自己的身体散发着烧焦的气味。

Dawn would find her in the courtyard, for she did not dare fall asleep lest she dream of the English and their ferocious attack dogs as they came through the windows of her bedroom to submit her to shameful tortures with their red-hot irons.<br />她在院中呆到天明，未曾入睡，以免梦见英国人和他们凶猛的攻击犬，他们会翻进卧室的窗户，用烧红的烙铁让她受尽可耻的折磨。<br /> <br />Her husband, an Aragonese merchant by whom she had two children, spent half the value of his store on medicines and pastimes in an attempt to alleviate her terror. Finally he sold the business and took the family to live far from the sea in a settlement of peaceful Indians located in the foothills, where he built his wife a bedroom without windows so that the pirates of her dream would have no way to get in.<br />她的丈夫是一个阿拉贡商人，他们有两个孩子。为了缓和她的恐惧，丈夫耗费店铺一半的收入用于药品和休闲活动。最后，他把自己的生意转让了出去，带着家庭远离大海，住在一个山麓下和睦的印第安人聚居地。在那里，他为妻子建造了一间没有窗户的卧室，这样妻子噩梦中的海盗就无法进入她的卧室了。

In that hidden village there was a native-born tobacco planter who lived there for some time, Don José Arcadio Buendía, with whom Úrsula's great-great-grandfather established a partnership that was so lucrative that within a few years they made a fortune.<br />在这个隐蔽的村庄，一个本地烟草种植户何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚已经在此住了一段时间，乌尔苏拉的曾曾祖父和他建立合作关系，短短几年便发了大财。

Several centuries later the great-great-grandson of the native-born planter married the great-great-granddaughter of the Aragonese.<br />几个世纪以后，本地种植户的玄孙和阿拉贡商人的玄孙女结婚了。

Therefore, every time that Úrsula went crazy with her husband's follies, she would leap back over three hundred years of coincidences and curse the day that Sir Francis Drake had  attacked Riohacha.<br />因此，每当乌尔苏拉因为丈夫荒唐的想法而几近疯狂的时候，她会越过三百年的巧合，诅咒弗朗西斯·德雷克爵士攻打奥阿查的那一天。（此句英文版翻译诘屈聱牙，根据西语重新翻译）

It was simply a way of giving herself some relief, because actually they were joined till death by a bond that was more solid than love: a common prick of conscience. They were cousins.<br />这仅仅只是一种缓解的方式，因为实际上他们通过一种比爱情更坚固的关系连接在一起，直到死亡：即良心上的共同点，他们是表兄妹。

They had grown up together in the old village that both of their ancestors, with their work and their good habits, had transformed into one of the finest towns in the province.<br />他们在那个古老的村庄一起长大，各自的先辈，凭借着他们的工作和良好的生活习惯，使那里成为省内最好的城镇之一。

Although their marriage was predicted from the time they had come into the world, when they expressed their desire to be married their own relatives tried to stop it.<br />他们来到这个世界，联姻便已注定，但是当他们表露出结婚的愿望时，他们的亲戚却试图阻止。

They were afraid that those two heathly products of two races that had interbred over the centuries would suffer the shame of breeding iguanas. There had already been a horrible precedent.<br />他们担心两个家族几个世纪以来的结合繁衍， 这两个健康的后代将会遭受生育出鬣蜥的可耻之事。事实上，已经有了一个可怕的先例。

An aunt of Úrsula's, married to an uncle of José Arcadio Buendía, had a son who went through life wearing loose, baggy trousers and who bled to death after having lived forty-two years in the purest state of virginity, for he had been born and had grown up with a cartilaginous tail in the shape of a corkscrew and with a small tuft of hair on the tip.<br />乌尔苏拉的一位姑妈嫁给了何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚的一位叔叔，他们有个儿子一生都穿着宽松肥大的裤子，在纯洁的童真中活了四十二年，最后失血而死。他一出生就长着一条螺旋状的软骨尾巴，末端还有一绺毛发。

A pig's tail that was never allowed to be seen by any woman and that cost him his life when a butcher friend did him the favor of chopping it off with his cleaver.<br />从未让任何一个女人看过他的猪尾巴，当屠夫朋友用剁肉刀帮他切掉尾巴后，他为此付出了生命的代价。

José Arcadio Buendía, with a single phrase: "I don't care if I have piglets as long as they can talk." So they were married amidst a festival of fireworks and a brass band that went on for three days.<br />何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚只说了一句话：“我不在乎生下的是猪崽，只要会说话就行”。在烟火和铜管乐队表演中，他们结婚了，婚礼持续了三天。

They would have been happy from then on if Úrsula's mother had not terrified her with all manner of sinister predictions about their offspring, even to the extreme of advising her to refuse to consummate the marriage.<br />从那时起，如果乌尔苏拉的母亲没有用对他们后代的各种阴险预测来吓唬她，甚至极端地建议乌尔苏拉拒绝和丈夫发生性行为，他们本来会很幸福。

Fearing that her stout and willful husband would rape her while she slept, Úrsula, before going to bed, would put on a rudimentary kind of drawers that her mother had made out of sailcloth and had reinforced with a system of crisscrossed leather straps and that was closed for several months.<br />由于担心强壮又任性的丈夫趁她熟睡之际强奸自己。乌尔苏拉睡觉前，都会穿上一条裤子，这是她母亲用简陋的帆布做的，采用纵横交错的皮带加固，几个月都没有解开过。

During the day he would take care of his fighting cocks and she would do frame embroidery with her mother. At night they would wrestle for several hours in an anguished violence that seemed to be a substitute for the act of love, until popular intuition got a whiff of something irregular and the rumor spread that Úrsula was still a virgin a year after her marriage because her husband was impotent. José Arcadio Buendía was the last one to hear the rumor.<br />这段时间里，丈夫饲养他的斗鸡，她和母亲做刺绣。晚上在痛苦的暴力中和丈夫搏斗数小时，似乎以此代替了夫妻生活。直到直觉感受到了一股异常，谣言说因为丈夫的性无能，乌尔苏拉结婚一年了仍然是一个处女。何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚是最后一个听到这个谣言的人。

"Look at what people are going around saying, Úrsula," he told his wife very calmly.<br />“瞧瞧周围的人说的是什么，乌尔苏拉”，他非常镇静地对妻子说。

"Let them talk," she said. "We know that it's not true."<br />“让他们说去吧，”她说。“我们知道这不是真的。”

So the situation went on the same way for another six months until that tragic Sunday when José Arcadio Buendía won a cockfight from Prudencio Aguilar. Furious, aroused by the blood of his bird, the loser backed away from José Arcadio Buendía so that everyone in the cockpit could hear what he was going to tell him.<br />这种情况持续了六个月，直到那个悲惨的星期天，何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚打败普鲁登西奥·阿吉拉尔，赢得了斗鸡比赛。失败者被他的斗鸡淋漓的鲜血激怒了，他从何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚身边后退几步，以便斗鸡场上的所有人能听清他要说的话。

"Congratulations!" he shouted. "Maybe that rooster of yours can do your wife a favor."<br />“恭喜！”他说，“你的公鸡也许能得到你老婆的宠爱。”

José Arcadio Buendía serenely picked up his rooster. "I'll be right back," he told everyone. And then to Prudencio Aguilar:<br />何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚镇静地抱起他的公鸡。“我马上回来，”他对所有人说，然后对普鲁登西奥·阿吉拉尔说：

"You go home and get a weapon, because I'm going to kill you."<br />“滚回家拿上武器，因为我要宰了你。”

Ten minutes later he returned with the notched spear that had belonged to his grandfather. At the door to the cockpit, where half the town had gathered, Prudencio Aguilar was waiting for him.<br />十分钟后，他带着祖父的长矛回来了，在斗鸡场门口，聚集了村庄上一半的人，普鲁登西奥·阿吉拉尔正在等他。

There was no time to defend himself. José Arcadio Buendía's spear, thrown with the strength a bull and with the same good aim with which the first Aureliano Buendía had exterminated the jaguars in the region, pierced his throat.<br />毫无时间自卫，何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚以公牛般的力量投掷出长矛，像第一代何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚射杀美洲豹一样的瞄准精确度，刺穿了普鲁登西奥·阿吉拉尔的喉咙。

That night, as they held a wake over the corpse in the cockpit, José Arcadio Buendía went into the bedroom as his wife was putting on her chastity pants. Pointing the spear at her he ordered: "Take them off." Úrsula had no doubt about her husband's decision. "You'll be responsible for what happens," she murmured. José Arcadio Buendía stuck the spear into the dirt floor.<br />晚上，人们在斗鸡场尸体旁守灵，何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚走进卧室，妻子正在穿贞节裤，他指着长矛命令道：“脱掉它。”乌尔苏拉没有怀疑丈夫的决定，“你得为发生的事负责，”她小声地说。何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚将长矛插在地上。

"If you bear iguanas, we'll raise iguanas," he said. "But there'll be no more killings in this town because of you."<br />“如果你生的是鬣蜥，我们就抚养鬣蜥，”他说。“至少以后村镇上不会有人因为你而被杀。”

It was a fine June night, cool a moon, and they were awake and frolicking in bed until dawn, indifferent to the breeze that passed through the bedroom, loaded with the weeping of Prudencio Aguilar's kin.<br />这是六月里的一个美好夜晚，月色宜人，他们彻夜未眠，在床上嬉戏，直到天亮。任凭微风载着普鲁登西奥·阿吉拉尔家属的哭泣，吹过卧室。

The matter was put down as a duel of honor, but both of them were left with a twinge in their conscience.<br />这件事视为荣誉决斗而渐渐平息，但是给夫妻二人在良心上留下了不快。

One night, when she could not sleep, Úrsula went out into the courtyard to get some water and she saw Prudencio Aguilar by the water jar.<br />某个晚上，乌尔苏拉睡不着，她走进院子里取水，在水缸旁边看见了普鲁登西奥·阿吉拉尔。

He was livid, a sad expression on his face, trying to cover the hole in his throat with a plug made esparto grass. It did not bring on fear in her, but pity. She went back to the room and told her husband what she had seen, but he did not think much of it.<br />他浑身发青，脸上表情悲伤，试图用细茎针草堵住喉咙上的洞口。乌尔苏拉并没有感到害怕，而是充满了怜悯。她回到房间，把看到的告诉了丈夫，但他并没有多想。

"This just means that we can't stand the weight of our conscience." Two nights later Úrsula saw Prudencio Aguilar again, in the bathroom, using the esparto plug to wash the clotted blood from his throat.<br />“这只是我们无法承受良心上的压力。”两天以后，乌尔苏拉再次看到了普鲁登西奥·阿吉拉尔，他正在浴室里用细茎针草清洗喉咙上凝结的血块。

On another night she saw him strolling in the rain. José Arcadio Buendía, annoyed by his wife's hallucinations, went out into the courtyard armed with the spear. There was the dead man with his sad expression.<br />在另一个晚上，她看见他在雨中漫步。何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚因妻子的幻觉而恼火，抄起长矛冲进院子里，看见那个死者，面带悲伤。

"You go to hell," José Arcadio Buendía shouted at him. "Just as many times as you come back, I'll kill you again."<br />“你回地狱去吧，”何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚对他喊道。“你再回来几次，我就再杀你几次。”

Prudencio Aguilar did not go away, nor did José Arcadio Buendía dare throw the spear. He never slept well after that.<br />普鲁登西奥·阿吉拉尔没有离开，何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚也没敢扔出长矛。从此，他再也睡不着了。

He was tormented by the immense desolation with which the dead man had looked at him through the rain, his deep nostalgia as he yearned for living people, the anxiety with which he searched through the house looking for some water with which to soak his esparto plug.<br />他被无尽的孤寂折磨着，死者在雨中望着他，对活人生活深深地怀念，他焦急地在屋子里寻找水源，浸泡他的细茎针草。

"He must be suffering a great deal," he said to Úrsula. "You can see that he's so very lonely." She was so moved that the next time she saw the dead man uncovering the pots on the stove she understood what he was looking for, and from then on she placed water jugs all about the house.<br />“他一定非常的痛苦，”他对乌尔苏拉说。“能看得出来他非常的孤独。”她非常地感动，下次当她看到死者揭开炉灶上的锅时，她明白了他在寻找什么。从那时起，她在房子周围放满了水坛。

One night when he found him washing his wound in his own room, José Anedio Buendía could no longer resist.<br />一天晚上，当何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚在自己的房间发现他正在清洗伤口，再也无法忍受。

"It's all right, Prudencio," he told him. "We're going to leave this town, just as far away as we can go, and we'll never come back. Go in peace now."<br />“好吧，普鲁登西奥，”他对死者说，“我们将离开这个城镇，尽可能的远离，永远不会回来，你现在安息吧。”

That was how they undertook the crossing of the mountains. Several friends of José Arcadio Buendía, young men like him, excited, by the adventure, dismantled their houses and packed up, along with their wives and children, to head toward the land that no one had promised them.<br />这就是他们穿越山脉的原因。何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚的几个朋友，像他一样的年轻人，对即将的探险而兴奋，拆卸打包好他们的房屋，带上妻子和孩子，走向无人承诺的土地。

Before he left, José Arcadio Buendía buried the spear in the courtyard and, one after the other, he cut the throats of his magnificent fighting cocks, trusting that in that way he could give some measure of peace to Prudencio Aguilar.<br />离开前，何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚将长矛埋在院子里，一个接一个地，割开了雄赳赳的斗鸡的喉咙，相信用这种方式能给普鲁登西奥·阿吉拉尔带来一些和平。

All that Úrsula took along were a trunk bridal clothes, a few household utensils, and the small chest with the gold pieces that she had inherited from her father.<br />乌尔苏拉的所有东西包括，一箱嫁衣，几件家具，以及继承自父亲的装着金币的小箱子。

They did not lay out any definite itinerary. They simply tried to go in a direction opposite to the road to Riohacha so that they would not leave any trace or meet any people they knew. It was an absurd journey. After fourteen months, her stomach corrupted by monkey meat and snake stew, Úrsula gave birth to a son who had all of his features human.<br />他们没有规划明确的行程，只是试着朝奥阿查相反方向的路走，这样将不会留下任何踪迹，不会遇见任何认识他们的人，这是一段荒谬的旅程。十四个月以后，乌尔苏拉因猴子肉和蛇汤吃坏了肚子，生了一个儿子，带着人类所有的特征。

She had traveled half of the trip in a hammock that two men carried on their shoulders, because swelling had disfigured her legs and her varicose veins had puffed up like bubbles. Although it was pitiful to see them with their sunken stomachs and languid eyes, the children survived the journey better than their parents, and most of the time it was fun for them.<br />她一半的旅程都在吊床上度过，两个男人把她担在肩上，因为肿胀使她的腿变形，静脉曲张鼓胀得像气泡。他们凹陷的腹部和疲倦的眼神，甚是可怜，但是孩子在旅程中活得比父母还好，对他们来说大部分时间都很有趣。

One morning, after almost two years of crossing, they became the first mortals to see the western slopes of the mountain range. From the cloudy summit they saw the immense aquatic expanse of the great swamp as it spread out toward the other side of the world. But they never found the sea.<br />一个清晨，经过近两年的跋涉，他们成为第一批看到山脉西面的人。从氤氲的山顶望去，辽阔的大沼泽延伸到世界的另一边。但是他们从未找到大海。

One night, after several months of lost wandering through the swamps, far away now from the last Indians they had met on their way, they camped on the banks of a stony river whose waters were like a torrent of frozen glass.<br />一天晚上，在大沼泽迷失游荡了几个月之后，远离途中遇到的最后一批印第安人，他们在布满石头的河岸边扎营，河水如凝固的玻璃。

Years later, during the second civil war, Colonel Aureliano Buendía tried to follow that same route in order to take Riohacha by surprise and after six days of traveling he understood that it was madness.<br />多年以后，在第二次内战期间，奥雷里亚诺·布恩迪亚上校试图遵循同样的路线突袭奥阿查，经过六天的行军，他明白这是疯狂之举。

Nevertheless, the night on which they camped beside the river, his father's host had the look of ship-wrecked people with no escape, but their number had grown during the crossing and they were all prepared (and they succeeded) to die of old age.<br />尽管如此，他们在河边扎营的那个晚上，他的父亲及同行者看着像是海难中无处逃生的人，但在旅途中他们的人数在不断增加，并且他们将长命百岁（事实上确实如此）。

José Arcadio Buendía dreamed that night that right there a noisy city with houses having mirror walls rose up. He asked what city it was and they answered him with a name that he had never heard, that had no meaning at all, but that had a supernatural echo in his dream: Macondo.<br />那晚何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚梦见一座喧闹的城市，玻璃幕墙大厦拔地而起。他问这是什么城市，他们回答他的是一个从未听过的，没有任何意思的名字，但是在梦里有一个超自然的回声：马孔多。

On the following day he convinced his men that they would never find the sea. He ordered them to cut down the trees to make a clearing beside the river, at the coolest spot on the bank, and there they founded the village.<br />第二天，他说服其他人，永远也找不到大海。他让人们砍掉树木，在河岸边清理出一片阴凉之地，建起了一座村庄。

José Arcadio Buendía did not succeed in deciphering the dream of houses with mirror walls until the day he discovered ice. Then he thought he understood its deep meaning. He thought that in the near future they would be able to manufacture blocks of ice on a large scale from such a common material as water them build the new houses of the village.<br />何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚直到认识了冰的那一天，才破译了关于玻璃幕墙大厦的梦。他认为自己理解了其中的深刻含义，在不远的将来，人们使用像水这样的普通材料能够大规模地制造冰块，从而建造村庄里的新房子。

Macondo would no longer be a burning place, where the hinges and door knockers twisted with the heat, but would be changed into a wintry city.<br />马孔多不再是一个合叶和门环热得弯曲变形的酷热之地，将变成一个寒冷的城市。

He did not persevere in his attempts to build an ice factory, it was because at that time he was absolutely enthusiastic over the education of his sons, especially that of Aureliano, who from the first had revealed a strange intuition for alchemy.<br />他并没有坚持不懈地试图建造冰厂，因为当时他全身心投入在儿子们的教育中，特别是奥雷里亚诺，他从一开始就对炼金术流露出了好奇心。

The laboratory had been dusted off. Reviewing Melquíades' notes, serene now, without the exaltation of novelty, in prolonged and patient sessions they tried to separate Úrsula's gold from the debris that was stuck to the bottom of the pot.<br />实验室已经打扫干净，安静地阅读梅尔基亚德斯的笔记，将新奇事物带来的兴奋置之度外。在长期和耐心的交流中，他们试图将乌尔苏拉的黄金从粘在锅底的废渣中分离出来。

Young José Arcadio scarcely took part in the process.While his father was involved body and soul with his water pipe, the willful first-born, who had always been too big for his age, had become a monumental  . His voice had changed. An incipient fuzz appeared on his upper lip.<br />年轻的何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥几乎没有参与这个过程。当他的父亲倾注身心在他的仪器中时，这个任性的头生子，已经长大，成为一个青少年。他的声音变了，上唇刚长出了胡子。

One night, as Úrsula went into the room where he was undressing to go to bed, she felt a mingled sense of shame and pity: he was the first man that she had seen naked after her husband, and he was so well equipped for life that he seemed abnormal. Úrsula, pregnant for the third time, relived her newlywed terror.<br />一天晚上，乌尔苏拉进入房间，碰巧遇见他正脱衣准备睡觉，她感到一种羞涩和怜悯的混杂感受：她是在丈夫之后第一次看到裸体的男人，他生活条件很好，但是身体看上去很不正常。此时乌尔苏拉第三次怀孕，再次体验到了新婚时的恐惧。

Around that time a merry, foul-mouthed, provocative woman came to the house to help with the chorea, and she knew how to read the future in cards. Úrsula spoke to about her son. She thought that his disproportionate size was something as unnatural as her cousin's tail of a pig.<br />那时，一个爽快、满嘴脏话、性感的女人来到她家诊治舞蹈症，此人知道如何通过纸牌预测未来。乌尔苏拉谈及到她的儿子，她认为他不成比例的身体大小就像她表兄弟的猪尾巴一样不正常。

The woman let out an expansive laugh that resounded through the house like a spray of broken glass. "Just the opposite," she said. "He'll be very lucky." In order to confirm her prediction she brought her cards to the house a few days later and locked herself up with José Arcadio in a granary off the kitchen.<br />那个女人哈哈大笑起来，仿佛散落的玻璃碎片在房间中回响。“恰恰相反，”她说，“他会非常幸运。”为了证实她的预言，几天后她把纸牌带到乌尔苏拉家，把自己和何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥锁在厨房外的粮仓里。

She calmly placed her cards on an old carpenter's bench. saying anything that came into her head, while the boy waited beside her, more bored than intrigued. Suddenly she reached out touched him.<br />她不慌不忙地将纸牌摊在木工凳上，默念着什么，男孩在她旁边等待着，百无聊赖。突然，她伸手去抚摸他。

"Lordy!" she said, sincerely startled, and that was all she could say. José Arcadio felt his bones filling up with foam, a languid fear, and a terrible desire to weep. The woman made no insinuations.But José Arcadio kept looking for her all night long, for the smell of smoke that she had under her armpits and that had got caught under his skin.<br />“老天爷啊！”她说，着实吓了一跳，再也说不出话来了。何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥感觉自己的骨头里塞满了海绵，慵懒的畏惧和可怕的欲望让他哭泣。这个女人没有任何暗示，但是何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥整夜都在找寻她。她腋下的烟味沾染在他的皮肤上。

He wanted to be with her all the time, he wanted her to be his mother, for them never to leave the granary, for her to say "Lordy!" to him.<br />她想永远和她在一起，让她做他的母亲，为了永远不离开那个粮仓，为了能对他说“我的老天爷”。

One day he could not stand it any more and he went looking for her at her house: He made a formal visit, sitting uncomprehendingly in the living room without saying a word. At that moment he had no desire for her. He found her different, entirely foreign to the image that her smell brought on, as if she were someone else.<br />一天，他再也不能忍受了，去她家找她：他做了一个正式的访问，不知不觉，没说一句话就坐在了起居室里，那一刻他对她没有欲望。他发现了差异，她的气味带来的完全是异域的形象，仿佛是另外一个人。

He drank his coffee and left the house in depression. That night, during the frightful time of lying awake, he desired her again with a brutal anxiety, but he did not want her that time as she had been in the granary but as she had been that afternoon.<br />他喝着咖啡，把房间弄得一团糟。晚上，醒后无精打采的时间里，强烈的焦虑让他再次恢复了欲望，但他渴望的不是在粮仓里的她，而是下午时候的她。

Days later the woman suddenly called him to her house, where she was alone with her mother, and she had him come into the bedroom with the pretext showing him a deck of cards. Then she touched such freedom that he suffered a delusion after the initial shudder, and he felt more fear than pleasure.<br />几天后，那个女人忽然叫他来她家，她单独和她母亲在一起。以向他展示一副纸牌为由，把他带进卧室。接着她尽情地抚摸他，在最初的颤抖之后他感觉到了失落，恐惧大于快乐。

She asked him to come and see her that night. He agreed. in order to get away, knowing that he was incapable of going. But that night, in his burning bed, he understood that he had to go we her, even if he were not capable.<br />她让何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥晚上再来，他答应了。他只是为了赶紧逃离，因为他知道自己不会再来了。但是夜晚，欲火焚身的床上，他明白必须要去找她，即使他不能这么做。

He got dressed by feel, listening in the dark to his brother's calm breathing, the dry cough of his father in the next room, the asthma of the hens in the courtyard, the buzz of the mosquitoes, the beating of his heart, and the inordinate bustle of a world that he had not noticed until then, and he went out into the sleeping street.<br />他凭着感觉穿上衣服，黑暗中听到弟弟平静的呼吸声，隔壁房间父亲的干咳声，院子里母鸡的气喘声，蚊子的嗡嗡声，自己的心跳声，以及之前从未注意到的喧嚣世界。然后他走到酣然入梦的街道。

With all his heart he wanted the door to be barred and not just closed as she had promised him. But it was open. He pushed it the tips of his fingers and the hinges yielded with a mournful and articulate moan that left a frozen echo inside of him. From the moment he entered, sideways and trying not to make a noise, he caught the smell.<br />他真心的希望门是关闭着的，而不是她承诺的那样虚掩着，但门是开着的。他用指尖推开门，合叶发出悲切清晰的呻吟声，在他身上留下冰冷的回声。从进门那刻开始，他侧着身子，尽量不发出声响，接着捕获到了那股气味。

He was still in the hallway, where the woman's three brothers had their hammocks in positions that he could not see and that he could not determine in the darkness as he felt his way along the hall to push open the bedroom door and get his bearings there so as not to mistake the bed.He found it.<br />他仍然呆在走廊上，女人的三个兄弟把吊床支在他看不见的位置，黑暗中也无法确定。他沿着大厅，摸索着行走，推开卧室的门，找准方位，以免明弄错床的位置。最终他找到了。

He bumped against the ropes of the hammocks, which were lower than he had suspected, and a man who had been snoring until then turned in his sleep and said in a kind of delusion, "It was Wednesday."<br />他绊到了吊床的绳索，因为比他猜测的要低。一个打着呼噜的男人在睡梦中翻了一个身，恍恍惚惚说了句“今天星期三”。

When he pushed open the bedroom door, he could not prevent it from scraping against the uneven floor. Suddenly, in the absolute darkness, he understood with a hopeless nostalgia that he was completely disoriented.<br />他推开卧室的门，不可避免地刮到不平坦的地板上。突然，在一团漆黑中，绝望地明白自己完全迷失了方向。

Sleeping in the narrow room were the mother, another daughter with her husband and two children, the woman, who may not have been there. He could have guided himself by the smell if the smell had not been all over the house, so devious and at the same time so definite, as it had always been on his skin.<br />睡在这个狭小房间里的有她的母亲，她的姐妹以及她的丈夫和两个孩子。那个女人也许并没有在这里。他能通过气味引导自己找到她，如果气味没有弥漫整个房子，令人迷惑又如此的明确，就像一直存在于皮肤上一样。

He did not move for a long time, wondering in fright how he had ever got to that abyss of abandonment, when a hand with all its fingers extended and feeling about in the darkness touched his face. He was not surprised, for without knowing, he had been expecting it.<br />他一动不动地待了许久，惊骇中想知道自己如何陷入放弃的深渊，这时，他感觉到一只手伸过来了，在黑暗中触摸她的脸。他措手不及，但并不惊讶，他期待这一刻。

Then he gave himself over to that hand, and in a terrible state of exhaustion he let himself be led to a shapeless place where his clothes were taken off and he was heaved about like a sack of potatoes and thrown from one side to the other in a bottomless darkness in which his arms were useless, where it no longer smelled of woman but of ammonia, and where he tried to remember her face and found before him the face of Úrsula, confusedly aware that he was doing something that for a very long time he had wanted to do but that he had imagined could really never be done, not knowing what he was doing because he did not know where his feet were or where his head was, or whose feet or whose head, and feeling that he could no longer resist the glacial rumbling of his kidneys and the air of his intestines, and fear, and the bewildered anxiety to flee and at the same time stay forever in that exasperated silence and that fearful solitude.<br />然后，在几近虚脱的糟糕状态中，他把自己托付给了这只手，跟随着到了一个无形之处。他的衣服被脱掉，像一袋土豆一样被举起，从一边扔到另一边，无尽的黑暗中他的手毫无用处。那里不再有那个女人的气味，只有一股氨气。他试图回忆她的样子，但出现的却是乌尔苏拉的样子。他稀里糊涂地察觉到自己正在做一件很久就想做的事情，只是从未想像到自己真的能做到。他不知道自己在做什么，因为他不知道自己的脚在哪里，头在哪里，或者是谁的脚，谁地头。他感觉抗拒不了肾脏中冰冷的声响和肠中的空气，恐惧和不知所措的焦虑让他逃离，同时又希望永远呆在这恼怒的沉寂和可怕的孤独中。

Her name was Pilar Ternera. She had been part of the exodus that ended with the founding of Macondo, dragged along by her family in order to separate her from the man who had raped her at fourteen and had continued to love her until she was twenty-two, but who never made up his mind to make the situation public because he was a man apart.<br />她的名字叫皮拉尔·特尔内拉，她参与过离开奥阿查到最后建立马孔多这一段旅程，不过是被家人强迫的，为了离开在她十四岁时强奸过她的那个男人。直到她二十二岁，那个男人依然爱着她，但从来没有下定决心公开他们的情况，因为他不是本地人。

He promised to follow her to the ends of the earth, but only later on, when he put his affairs in order, and she had become tired of waiting for him, always identifying him with the tall and short, blond and brunet men that her cards promised from land and sea within three days, three months, or three years.<br />他承诺跟随她到天涯海角，但不是现在，等他处理完自己的事情，她厌倦了等待。她总能在或高大或矮小，或金发或黑发的人群中把他辨认出来。纸牌预测他将在三天、三个月或三年内从陆地或海上来。

With her waiting she had lost the strength of her thighs, the firmness of her breasts, her habit of tenderness, but she kept the madness of her heart intact. Maddened by that prodigious plaything, José Arcadio followed her path every night through the labyrinth of the room.<br />等待中，她的大腿不再强壮，乳房不再坚挺，性格不再温柔，但依然保持着内心的狂野。何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥痴迷于这个尤物，每晚都要穿过迷宫般的房屋。

On a certain occasion he found the door barred, and he knocked several times, knowing that if he had the boldness to knock the first time he would have had to knock until the last, and after an interminable wait she opened the door for him.<br />一次他发现门被关上了，他敲了好几次，如果他有勇气敲第一次，便会一直往下敲下去，在无休止的等待之后，她为他开了门。

During the day, lying down to dream, he would secretly enjoy the memories of the night before. But when she came into the house, merry, indifferent, chatty, he did not have to make any effort to hide his tension, because that woman, whose explosive laugh frightened off the doves, had nothing to do with the invisible power that taught him how to breathe from within and control his heartbeats, and that had permitted him to understand why man are afraid of death.<br />白天，躺下做梦，他会偷偷地享受前一晚的回忆。当她来到他家，爽快，不拘小节，健谈，他甚至不必花费任何功夫去掩饰自己的紧张，因为这个爽朗的笑声能惊飞鸽子的女人与教他憋气呼吸和如何控制心跳，让他明白人为什么害怕死亡的无形力量毫无关系。

He was so wrapped up in himself that he did not even understand the joy of everyone when his father and his brother aroused the household with the news that they had succeeded in penetrating the metallic debris and had separated Úrsula's gold.<br />他沉浸在自己的世界里，当他的父亲和弟弟成功地把乌尔苏拉的黄金从金属废渣中彻底分离出来的好消息让全家激动万分时，他甚至不理解人们在高兴什么。

They had succeeded, as a matter of fact, after putting in complicated and persevering days at it. Úrsula was happy, and she even gave thanks to God for the invention of alchemy, while the people of the village crushed into the laboratory, and they served them guava jelly on crackers to celebrate the wonder, and José Arcadio Buendía let them see the crucible with the recovered gold, as if he had just invented it.<br />事实上，经历了繁复辛勤的几天时间，他们终于成功了。乌尔苏拉高兴极了，她甚至感谢上帝发明了炼金术。村庄里的人都簇拥在实验室里，他们用番石榴果冻饼干款待村民，以此庆祝这个奇迹。何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚把坩锅展示给他们看，里面有提取出来的黄金，就像是他制造出来的一样。

Showing it all around, he ended up in front of his older son, who during the past few days had barely put in an appearance in the laboratory. He put the dry and yellowish mass in front of his eyes and asked him: "What does it look like to you?"<br />展示了一圈，他最终停在了过去几天几乎没在实验室露过面的大儿子面前，他将干燥的淡黄色金属块放到儿子眼前，并问他：“你觉得怎么样？”

José Arcadio answered sincerely:"Dog shit."<br />何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥诚恳地回答说：“像狗屎。”

His father gave him a blow with the back of his hand that brought out blood and tears. That night Pilar Ternera put arnica compresses on the swelling, feeling about for the bottle and cotton in the dark, and she did everything she wanted with him as long as it did not bother him, making an effort to love him without hurting him. They reached such a state of intimacy that later, without realizing it, they were whispering to each other.<br />他的父亲反手给了他一巴掌，顿时鲜血眼泪直流。晚上皮拉尔·特尔内拉在黑暗中摸索药瓶和棉签，将山金草敷在肿胀处，她做任何想做的事，只要不惊扰他，努力爱他，不伤害他，他们最后达到了如此的亲密状态，不一会，他们就开始互相窃窃私语。

"I want to be alone with you," he said. "One these days I'm going to tell everybody we can stop all of this sneaking around."<br />“我想单独和你在一起。”他说。“总有一天，我要告诉所有人，这样我们就不用再四处偷偷摸摸。”

She did not try to calm him down.<br />她并没有劝其冷静。

"That would be fine," she said "If we're alone, we'll leave the lamp lighted so that we can see each other, and I can holler as much as I want without anybody's having to butt in, and you can whisper in my ear any crap you can think of."<br />“太好了，如果我们单独在一起，我们就可以点亮灯，能看到彼此，我们可以随心所欲地大喊大叫，没有任何人能插手，你可以在我耳边想说什么说什么。”

That conversation, the biting rancor that he felt against his father, and the imminent possibility of wild love inspired a serene courage in him. In a spontaneous way, without any preparation, he told everything to his brother.<br />那次谈话中，对父亲尖刻的怨恨和即将来临的狂野性爱，让他鼓起了一种坦然的勇气。没有任何准备，他直接就把这一切告诉了自己的弟弟。

At first young Aureliano understood only the risk, the immense possibility danger that his brother's adventures implied, and he could not understand the fascination of the subject. Little by little he became contaminated with the anxiety.
<br />起初年轻的奥雷里亚诺只意识到了风险，哥哥的冒险可能带来巨大的危险，他并不理解这方面的魅力，渐渐的，开始被哥哥的焦虑所感染。

He wondered about the details of the dangers, he identified himself with the suffering and enjoyment of his brother, he felt frightened and happy.<br />他想知道危险的细节，他认同哥哥的苦楚和享受，也为他感到担心和快乐。

He would stay awake waiting for him until dawn in the solitary bed that seemed to have a bottom of live coals, they would keep on talking until it was time to get up, so that both of them soon suffered from the same drowsiness, felt the same lack of interest in alchemy and the wisdom of their father, and they took refuge in solitude. "Those kids are out of their heads," Úrsula said. "They must have worms."<br />他保持着清醒，在孤单的床上等待着哥哥，直到天亮，翻来覆去好像床底下烧着炭火似的。他们夜谈到起床时分，以至于整天昏昏沉沉，对炼金术和父亲的聪明才智失去了兴趣，渐渐变得孤僻。“孩子们心不在焉，”乌尔苏拉说。“肚子里一定有蛔虫。”

She prepared a repugnant potion for them made out of mashed wormseed, which they both drank with unforeseen stoicism, and they sat down at the same time on their pots eleven times in a single day, expelling some rosecolored parasites that they showed to everybody with great jubilation, for it allowed them to deceive Úrsula as to the origin of their distractions and drowsiness.<br />她为他们准备了一剂令人恶心的药水，是用捣碎的驱虫籽制成的。他们俩用意想不到的坚忍喝掉了，与此同时他们一天内坐了十一次便池，并排出了一些玫瑰色的寄生虫。他们欢呼着展示给每个人看，为的是糊弄乌尔苏拉追究他们焦虑和困倦的起因。

Aureliano not only understood by then, he also lived his brother's experiences as something of his own, for on one occasion when the latter was explaining in great detail the mechanism of love, he interrupted him to ask: "What does it feel like?" José Arcadio gave an immediate reply:<br />奥雷里亚诺不仅理解了，对哥哥的经历感同身受，因为有一次当哥哥向他详细解释爱的原理时，他打断哥哥问道：“这是什么感觉？”何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥立即回答：

"It's like an earthquake."<br />“好像地震一般。”

One January Thursday at two o'clock in the morning, Amaranta was born. Before anyone came into the room, Úrsula examined her carefully. She was light and watery, like a newt, but all of her parts were human: Aureliano did not notice the new thing except when the house became full of people.<br />在一月的星期四的凌晨两点，阿玛兰塔出生了。人们进入房间之前，乌尔苏拉仔细的检查了一番。阿玛兰塔轻盈水润，犹如一条蝾螈，但是她身体的所有部位都是人的：奥雷里亚诺直到家里站满了人，才意识到这个新闻。

Protected by the confusion, he went off in search of his brother, who had not been in bed since eleven o'clock, it was such an impulsive decision that he did not even have time to ask himself how he could get him out of Pilar Ternera's bedroom.<br />趁着混乱，他溜出去寻找哥哥，哥哥早上十一点就不在床上了，如此冲动的决定甚至让他没有时间问自己如何让哥哥离开特尔内拉的卧室。

He circled the house for several hours, whistling private calls, until the proximity of dawn forced him to go home. In his mother's room, playing with the newborn little sister and with a face that drooped with innocence, he found José Arcadio.<br />他在房子周围盘旋了好几个小时，吹着口哨打暗号，直到快天亮了才迫使他回家。在母亲的房间里，他发现了何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥，他正在和小妹妹玩耍，一脸的天真无邪。

Úrsula was barely over her forty days' rest when the gypsies returned. They were the same acrobats and jugglers that had brought the ice. Unlike Melquíades' tribe, they had shown very quickly that they were not heralds of progress but purveyors of amusement.<br />当吉普赛人回来的时候，乌尔苏拉休息时间还没超过四十天。他们是一群带着冰的杂技演员和杂耍演员，与梅尔基亚德斯的部落不同，他们很快表明他们不是进步的先驱，而是娱乐的制造者。

Even when they brought the ice they did not advertise it for its usefulness in the life of man but as a simple circus curiosity. This time, along with many other artifices, they brought a flying carpet. But they did not offer it as a fundamental contribution to the development of transport, rather as an object of recreation.<br />即使他们带来了冰，却并没有宣扬它在生活上给人带来的用处，只是简单的作为马戏团好奇心。与其他许多发明人一起，他们还带来了一条飞行毯，但是他们没有把它作为交通发展的基本贡献，而是作为娱乐的对象。

The people at once dug up their last gold pieces to take advantage of a quick flight over the houses of the village. Protected by the delightful cover of collective disorder, José Arcadio and Pilar passed many relaxing hours. They were two happy lovers among the crowd, and they even came to suspect that love could be a feeling that was more relaxing and deep than the happiness, wild but momentary, of their secret nights.<br />人们立刻挖出他们最后的金币，体验一番在村庄的房顶上快速飞行。在混乱全体的愉悦掩护下，何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥和皮拉尔度过了许多轻松的时光。人群中的这两个幸福恋人，甚至怀疑爱情是一种相比秘密之夜的幸福、短暂的狂野更放松和更深刻的感觉。

Pilar, however, broke the spell. Stimulated by the enthusiasm that José Arcadio showed in her companionship, she confused the form and the occasion, and all of a sudden she threw the whole world on top of him. "Now you really are a man," she told him. And since he did not understand what she meant, she spelled it out to him.<br />然而，皮拉尔打破了这个咒语。在他们交往过程中何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥表现出来的热情的刺激下，她弄错了形式和场合，突然间让他的世界天翻地覆。“你现在真的是一个男人了，”她告诉他。因为他没有理解她这句话的意思，所以她就一字一句拼写给他看。

"You're going to be a father."<br />你将要做父亲了。

José Arcadio did not dare leave the house for several days. It was enough for him to hear the rocking laughter of Pilar in the kitchen to run and take refuge in the laboratory, where the artifacts of alchemy had come alive again with Úrsula's blessing.<br />何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥好几天不敢离开家，他能够听过厨房隐约传来的皮拉尔笑声，于是躲避到实验室去了。在乌尔苏拉的祝福下，炼金术的器物又重新使用起来了。

José Arcadio Buendía received his errant son with joy and initiated him in the search for the philosopher's stone, which he had finally undertaken. One afternoon the boys grew enthusiastic over the flying carpet that went swiftly by the laboratory at window level carrying the gypsy who was driving it and several children from the village who were merrily waving their hands, but José Arcadio Buendía did not even look at it.<br />何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚高兴地接受了这个犯过错误的儿子，最终他允诺，开始寻找哲学家之石。一天下午，越来越热衷飞行毯的男孩们，带着驾驶飞行毯的吉普赛人和几个村里的孩子，欢快地挥动他们的手，迅速地掠过实验室的窗外，但是何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚看都没看一眼。

"Let them dream," he said. "We'll do better flying than they are doing, and with more scientific resources than a miserable bedspread." In spite of his feigned interest, José Arcadio never understood the powers of the philosopher's egg, which to him looked like a poorly blown bottle. <br />“让他们做梦去吧，”他说。“我们会用更好的方法实现飞行，用的是比凄惨的床罩更科学的材料。”尽管假装很感兴趣，何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥从未理解“哲学家之卵”的威力，在他看来像一个糟糕的瓶子。

He did not succeed in escaping from his worries. He lost his appetite and he could not sleep. He fell into an ill humor, the same as his father's over the failure of his undertakings, and such was his upset that José Arcadio Buendía himself relieved him of his duties in the laboratory, thinking that he had taken alchemy too much to heart. <br />他没能摆脱自己的忧愁，没有胃口，睡不着觉,感觉自己就是一个笑话，就像父亲在事业上受到挫折一样。他忧愁万分，以至于何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚减轻了他在实验室的工作，认为他太专注于炼金术了。

Aureliano, of course, understood that his brother's affliction did not have its source in the search for the philosopher's stone but he could not get into his confidence. He had lost his former spontaneity. From an accomplice and a communicative person he had become withdrawn and hostile. Anxious for solitude, bitten by a virulent rancor against the world, one night he left his bed as usual, but he did not go to Pilar Ternera's house, but to mingle is the tumult of the fair. <br />奥雷里亚诺当然明白哥哥的痛苦并不是因为寻找“哲学家之石”导致的，但是哥哥已不再信任他，已不再像以前那样率真。从合伙人和一个乐于沟通的人变成了一个沉闷的充满敌意的人。对孤独的焦虑，被一种对世界的恶毒怨恨所困扰。一天晚上他像往常一样离开床，暗示他没有去皮拉尔·特尔内拉的家，而是混迹于混乱的展会中。

After wandering about among all kinds of contraptions without becoming interested in any of them, he spotted something that was not a part of it all: a very young gypsy girl, almost a child, who was weighted down by beads was the most beautiful woman that José Arcadio had ever seen in his life. <br />走过各种各样的玩意儿，对它们毫无兴趣。他注意到某个不属于这里的东西：一个非常年轻的吉普赛女郎，几乎是个孩子，她戴着沉重的珠子，这是何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥人生中见过最美的女人。

She was in the crowd that was witnessing the sad spectacle of the man who had been turned into a snake for having disobeyed his parents. <br />她正在人群中观看一个人因为忤逆父母而变成蛇的场景。

José Arcadio paid no attention. While the sad interrogation of the snakeman was taking place, he made his way through the crowd up to the front row, where the gypsy girl was, and he stooped behind her. <br />何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥并不在意此事，当蛇人正在被审讯时，他穿过人群来到前排吉普赛女郎在的地方，俯身站在她后面。

He pressed against her back. The girl tried to separate herself, but José Arcadio pressed more strongly against her back. Then she felt him. She remained motionless against him, trembling with surprise and fear, unable to believe the evidence, and finally she turned her head and looked at him with a tremulous smile. <br />他紧贴在她背后，女郎试图走开，但是何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥更紧地贴在她背后，她感觉到了。她一动不动地贴着，惊讶畏惧地颤抖着，无法相信这个事实，最后她转过头，带着颤抖着的微笑看着他。

At that instant two gypsies put the snake-man into his cage and carried him into the tent. The gypsy who was conducting the show announced:<br />此时，两个吉普赛人将蛇人装入笼中，带去了帐篷。主持这场演出的吉普赛人宣布：

"And now, ladies and gentlemen, we are going to show the terrible test of the woman who must have head chopped off every night at this time for one hundred and fifty years as punishment for having seen what she should not have."<br />现在，女士们先生们，我们将展示可怕的表演，一个女人在一百五十年里的每个晚上都要被砍头，以此惩罚她看了不该看的东西。

José Arcadio and the gypsy girl did not witness the decapitation. They went to her tent, where they kissed each other with a desperate anxiety while they took off their clothes. <br />何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥和吉普赛女郎并没有观看斩首表演。他们躲进了她的帐篷，脱掉衣服，急不可耐地亲吻。

The gypsy girl removed the starched lace corsets she had on and there she was, changed into practically nothing. She was a languid little frog, with incipient breasts and legs so thin that they did not even match the size of José Arcadio's arms, but she had a decision and a warmth that compensated for her fragility. <br />吉普赛女郎脱掉浆过花边的紧身胸衣和所有的衣服，身体几乎没有，像一只瘦弱的小青蛙。乳房刚刚发育，纤细的腿甚至没有何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥的胳膊粗。但是她的果断和热情弥补了她的羸弱。

Nevertheless, José Arcadio could not respond to her because they were in a kind of public tent where the gypsies passed through with their circus things and did their business, and would even tarry by the bed for a game dice. <br />然而，何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥没有回应她，因为他们在一个公共帐篷，吉普赛人带着马戏团道具经过，忙于他们的生意，甚至在床边停下来玩骰子游戏。

The lamp hanging from the center pole lighted the whole place up. During a pause in the caresses, José Arcadio stretched out naked on the bed without knowing what to do, while the girl tried to inspire him. <br />悬挂在木杆顶部的灯照亮了整个帐篷，爱抚间隙，何塞·阿尔卡蒂赤身裸体在床上伸着懒腰，无所事事，而女郎试图勾引她。

A gypsy woman with splendid flesh came in a short time after accompanied by a man who was not of the caravan but who was not from the village either, they both began to undress in front of the bed. Without meaning to, the woman looked at José Arcadio and examined his magnificent animal in repose with a kind of pathetic fervor.<br />

"My boy," she exclaimed, "may God preserve you just as you are."<br />José Arcadio's companion asked them to leave them alone, and the couple lay down on the ground, close to the bed. The passion of the others woke up José Arcadio's fervor. 

On the first contact the bones of the girl seemed to become disjointed with a disorderly crunch like the sound of a box of dominoes, and her skin broke out into a pale sweat and her eyes filled with tears as her whole body exhaled a lugubrious lament and a vague smell of mud. But she bore the impact with a firmness of character and a bravery that were admirable. 

José Arcadio felt himself lifted up into the air toward a state of seraphic inspiration, where his heart burst forth with an outpouring of tender obscenities that entered the girl through her ears and came out of her mouth translated into her language. It was Thursday. 

On Saturday night, José Arcadio wrapped a red cloth around his head and left with the gypsies.<br />When Úrsula discovered his absence she searched for him all through the village. In the remains of the gypsy camp there was nothing but a garbage pit among the still smoking ashes of the extinguished campfires. 

Someone who was there looking for beads among the trash told Úrsula that the night before he had seen her son in the tumult of the caravan pushing the snakeman's cage on a cart. "He's become a gypsy" she shouted to her husband, who had not shown the slightest sign of alarm over the disappearance.<br />

"I hope it's true," José Arcadio Buendía said, grinding in his mortar the material that had been ground a thousand times and reheated and ground again. "That way he'll learn to be a man." 

Úrsula asked where the gypsies had gone. She went along asking and following the road she had been shown, thinking that she still had time to catch up to them. She kept getting farther away from the village until she felt so far away that she did not think about returning. 

José Arcadio Buendía did not discover that his wife was missing until eight o'clock at night, when he left the material warming in a bed of manure and went to see what was wrong with little Amaranta, who was getting hoarse from crying. In a few hours he gathered a group of well-equipped men, put Amaranta in the hands a woman who offered to nurse her, and was lost on invisible paths in pursuit of Úrsula. 

Aureliano went with them. Some Indian fishermen, whose language they could not understand, told them with signs that they had not seen anyone pass. After three days of useless searching they returned to the village.<br />

For several weeks José Arcadio Buendía let himself be overcome by consternation. He took care of little Amaranta like a mother. He bathed and dressed her, took her to be nursed four times a day, and even sang to her at night the songs that Úrsula never knew how to sing. 

On a certain occasion Pilar Ternera volunteered to do the household chores until Úrsula came back. Aureliano, whose mysterious intuition had become sharpened with the misfortune, felt a glow of clairvoyance when he saw her come in. 

Then he knew that in some inexplicable way she was to blame for his brother's flight and the consequent disappearance his mother, and he harassed her with a silent and implacable hostility in such a way that the woman did not return to the house.<br />

Time put things in their place. José Arcadio Buendía and his son did not know exactly when they returned to the laboratory, dusting things, lighting the water pipe, involved once more in the patient manipulation of the material that had been sleeping for several months in its bed of manure. 

Even Amaranta, lying in a wicker basket, observed with curiosity the absorbing work of her father and her brother in the small room where the air was rarefied by mercury vapors. On a certain occasion, months after Úrsula's departure, strange things began to happen. 

An empty flask that had been forgotten in a cupboard for a long time became so heavy that it could not be moved. A pan of water on the worktable boiled without any fire under it for a half hour until it completely evaporated. José Arcadio Buendía and his son observed those phenomena with startled excitement, unable to explain them but interpreting them as predictions of the material. 

One day Amaranta's basket began to move by itself and made a complete turn about the room, to the consternation of Auerliano, who hurried to stop it. But his father did not get upset. He put the basket in its place and tied it to the leg of a table, convinced that the longawaited event was imminent. 

It was on that occasion that Auerliano heard him say:<br />

"If you don't fear God, fear him through the metals.<br />

Suddenly, almost five months after her disappearance, Úrsula came back. She arrived exalted, rejuvenated, with new clothes in a style that was unknown in the village. José Arcadio Buendía could barely stand up under the impact. "That was it!" he shouted. "I knew it was going to happen." 

And he really believed it, for during his prolonged imprisonment as he manipulated the material, he begged in the depth of his heart that the longed-for miracle should not be the discovery of the philosopher's stone, or the freeing of the breath that makes metals live, or the faculty to convert the hinges and the locks of the house into gold, but what had just happened: Úrsula's return. But she did not share his excitement. She gave him a conventional kiss, as if she had been away only an hour, and she told him:<br />

"Look out the door."<br />

José Arcadio Buendía took a long time to get out of his perplexity when he went out into the street and saw the crowd. They were not gypsies. They were men and women like them, with straight hair and dark skin, who spoke the same language and complained the same pains.

They had mules loaded down with things to eat, oxcarts with furniture and domestic utensils, pure and simple earthly accessories put on sale without any fuss by peddlers of everyday reality.

They came from the other side of the swamp, only two days away, where there were towns that received mail every month in the year where they were familiar with the implements of good living.

Úrsula had not caught up with the gypsies, but she had found the route that her husband had been unable to discover in his frustrated search for the great inventions.
