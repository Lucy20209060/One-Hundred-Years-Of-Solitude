The new house, white, like a dove, was inaugurated with a dance. Úrsula had got that idea from the afternoon when she saw Rebeca and Amaranta changed into adolescents, and it could almost have been said that the main reason behind the construction was a desire to have a proper place for the girls to receive visitors.<br />新居粉饰得白如雪鸽，在舞蹈中举行了落成仪式。乌尔苏拉是在那个下午看到丽贝卡和阿玛兰塔已长成亭亭玉立的少女，才萌生了这个主意，几乎可以说，建造新居的主要原因是希望女儿们能有个合适的地方接待宾客。

In order that nothing would be lacking in splendor she worked like a galley slave as the repairs were under way, so that before they were finished she had ordered costly necessities for the decorations, the table service, and the marvelous invention that was to arouse the astonishment of the town and the jubilation of the young people: the pianola.<br />为确保十全十美，在修建过程中她像奴隶苦役一样辛勤地工作。完工之前，她订购了昂贵的必需装饰品、餐桌服务以及足以令全镇惊愕和年轻人为之欢呼的奇妙发明：自动钢琴。

They delivered it broken down, packed in several boxes that were unloaded along with the Viennese furniture, the Bohemian crystal, the table service from the Indies Company, the tablecloths from Holland, and a rich variety of lamps and candlesticks, hangings and drapes. The import house sent along at its own expense an Italian expert, Pietro Crespi, to assemble and tune the pianola, to instruct the purchasers in its functioning, and to teach them how to dance the latest music printed on its six paper rolls.<br />他们将其分解递送，装在多个箱子里，一同卸载下来的还有维也纳家具，波西米亚水晶制品，印度公司的餐桌服务，荷兰的桌布和各式各样的灯、烛台、帷幔、帷帘。进口公司自费派遣了一个意大利专家——皮埃特罗·克雷斯皮，负责组装调试钢琴，指导买家如何使用，并教授如何伴着六卷纸带上的新潮音乐跳舞。

Pietro Crespi was young and blond, the most handsome and well mannered man who had ever been seen in Macondo, so scrupulous in his dress that in spite of the suffocating heat he would work in his brocade vest and heavy coat of dark cloth. Soaked in sweat, keeping a reverent distance from the owners of the house, he spent several weeks shut up is the parlor with a dedication much like that of Aureliano in his silverwork.<br />皮埃特罗·克雷斯皮是个金发碧眼的年轻人，也是在马孔多见过最英俊又彬彬有礼的男人。他非常注重仪表，尽管天气窒息般燥热，他工作时仍然穿着锦缎背心和厚厚的深色呢子上衣，满头大汗，与房主保持着恭敬的距离，好几周把自己关在客厅，无私奉献地工作，就像奥雷里亚诺对待他的银制工艺品。

One morning, without opening the door, without calling anyone to witness the miracle, he placed the first roll in the pianola and the tormenting hammering and the constant noise of wooden lathings ceased in a silence that was startled at the order and neatness of the music. They all ran to the parlor.<br />一天早上，没有开门，也没有召集人见证此刻奇迹，他在自动钢琴上装好第一卷纸带，恼人的捶打声和木板条持续的噪声戛然而止，纯净有序的音乐响起，人们都纷纷跑来客厅。

José Arcadio Buendía was as if struck by lightning, not because of the beauty of the melody, but because of the automatic working of the keys of the pianola, and he set up Melquíades' camera with the hope of getting a daguerreotype of the invisible player.<br />何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚好似被闪电击中，不是因为旋律之优美，而是因为琴键在自动弹奏。他架起梅尔基亚德斯的照相机，希望拍到这位隐形演奏者的照片。

That day the Italian had lunch with them. Rebeca and Amaranta, serving the table, were intimidated by the way in which the angelic man with pale and ringless hands manipulated the utensils. In the living room, next to the parlor, Pietro Crespi taught them how to dance. He showed them the steps without touching them, keeping time with a metronome, under the friendly eye of Úrsula, who did not leave the room for a moment while her daughters had their lesson.<br />那天这位意大利人与他们共进午餐。在餐桌旁服务的丽贝卡和阿玛兰塔惊诧于这个天使般的男人苍白尚未戴戒指的苍白双手操作刀叉的方式。在客厅旁边的起居室，皮埃特罗·克雷斯皮教她们跳舞。跟随着节拍器，在身体不触碰到她们的情况下向她们展示舞步。乌尔苏拉友好地监视着，女儿上课期间，她未曾一刻离开过房间。

Pietro Crespi wore special pants on those days, very elastic and tight, and dancing slippers, "You don't have to worry so much," José Arcadio Buendía told her. "The man's a fairy." But she did not leave off her vigilance until the apprenticeship was over and the Italian left Macondo.<br />皮埃特罗·克雷斯皮那时穿着舞鞋和特殊的裤子，非常的紧身有弹性。何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚告诉乌尔苏拉，“这人是个同性恋。”但她没有放松警惕，直到学徒期结束，意大利人离开了马孔多才作罢。

Then they began to organize the party. Úrsula drew up a strict guest list, in which the only ones invited were the descendants of the founders, except for the family of Pilar Ternera, who by then had two more children by unknown fathers.<br />接着他们开始组织宴会。乌尔苏拉制定了一份严格的来宾名单，受邀的只有马孔多创建者的后代，除了皮拉尔·特尔内拉一家，这个女人又生个两个父亲不明的孩子。

It was truly a highclass list, except that it was determined by feelings of friendship, for those favored were not only the oldest friends of José Arcadio Buendía's house since before they undertook the exodus and the founding of Macondo, but also their sons and grandsons, who were the constant companions of Aureliano and Arcadio since infancy, and their daughters, who were the only ones who visited the house to embroider with Rebeca and Amaranta.<br />这是一份真正的高等级名单，只不过是通过友情来决定的，因为受邀者不仅在背井离乡到此建立马孔多之前就已经是何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚家的老朋友了，而且他们的儿孙们跟奥雷里亚诺和阿尔卡蒂奥从小就是伙伴，他们的女儿也是唯一可以来她家与丽贝卡和阿玛兰塔一同绣花的。

Don Apolinar Moscote, the benevolent ruler whose activity had been reduced to the maintenance from his scanty resources of two policemen armed with wooden clubs, was a figurehead. In older to support the household expenses his daughters had opened a sewing shop, where they made felt flowers as well as guava delicacies, and wrote love notes to order. But in spite of being modest and hard-working, the most beautiful girls in Iowa, and the most skilled at the new dances, they did not manage to be considered for the party.<br />仁慈的镇长堂·阿波利纳尔·摩斯科特的职责被削减到仅限于用微薄的经费供养两名用木棒武装的警察，不过是有名无实。为了养家糊口，他的女儿们开了一家裁缝铺，她们制作毡花和番石榴食品，以及代人写情书。但是尽管她们谦逊勤劳，是镇上最漂亮的姑娘，新式舞蹈也非常的熟练，却根本没有被考虑邀请参加宴会。

While Úrsula and the girls unpacked furniture, polished silverware, and hung pictures of maidens in boats full of roses, which gave a breath of new life to the naked areas that the masons had built, José Arcadio Buendía stopped his pursuit of the image of God, convinced of His nonexistence, and he took the pianola apart in order to decipher its magical secret.<br />乌尔苏拉和女孩子们取出家具，擦亮银器，挂起玫瑰花舟载少女图，这给泥瓦匠刚建造的毛坯房带来新的生机。何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚已停止了对上帝影像的追踪，并且认为上帝是不存在的。他拆开自动钢琴，期望破译其神奇奥秘。

Two days before the party, swamped in a shower of leftover keys and hammers, bungling in the midst of a mixup of strings that would unroll in one direction and roll up again in the other, he succeeded in a fashion in putting the instrument back together. There had never been as many surprises and as much dashing about as in those days, but the new pitch lamps were lighted on the designated day and hour.<br />宴会的前两天，他被埋没在一大堆螺钉和木槌里，在杂乱的弦线中瞎忙活，弦线刚从一端把它们伸直，立刻又从另一端卷了起来，好不容易才把钢琴重新装配好。何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚从未有过如此多的惊喜和活力，但是新柏油灯在规定好的日期被点亮。

The house was opened, still smelling of resin and damp whitewash, and the children and grandchildren of the founders saw the porch with ferns and begonias, the quiet rooms, the garden saturated with the fragrance of the roses, and they gathered together in the parlor, facing the unknown invention that had been covered with a white sheet.<br />房子敞开着，仍然能闻到树脂和粉刷湿气的气息。马孔多建立者的子孙们参观着摆着蕨类和秋海棠的长廊，幽静的房间，弥漫着玫瑰芬芳的花园，最后他们聚集到了客厅，簇拥在覆盖着白色床单的未知发明周围。

Those who were familiar with the piano, popular in other towns in the swamp, felt a little disheartened, but more bitter was Úrsula's disappointment when she put in the first roll so that Amaranta and Rebeca could begin the dancing and the mechanism did not work. Melquíades, almost blind by then, crumbling with decrepitude, used the arts of his timeless wisdom in an attempt to fix it. Finally José Arcadio Buendía managed, by mistake, to move a device that was stuck and the music came out, first in a burst and then in a flow of mixed-up notes.<br />自动钢琴在沼泽区的其他城镇已经开始流行，熟悉自动钢琴的人们有些失望，但是让乌尔苏拉更加失望的是，她放上第一卷纸带，以便阿玛兰塔和丽贝卡能随之起舞，但是自动钢琴并没有反应。梅尔基亚德斯那时几乎已经看不见了，衰老不堪，企图使用他那古老的智慧修复它。最后何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚误打误撞地移动了一个被卡住的设备，音乐便出来了，起初是突然响起，接着是一串混乱的音符。

Beating against the strings that had been put in without order or concert and had been tuned with temerity, the hammers let go. But the stubborn descendants of the twenty-one intrepid people who plowed through the mountains in search of the sea to the west avoided the reefs of the melodic mix-up and the dancing went on until dawn.<br />木槌敲击被随意调节过的凌乱琴弦后，纷纷开始松动。然而，二十一位翻山越岭向西寻找大海的勇士的顽固后代们，避开了旋律的杂乱礁石，起舞到天明。

Pietro Crespi came back to repair the pianola. Rebeca and Amaranta helped him put the strings in order and helped him with their laughter at the mix-up of the melodies. It was extremely pleasant and so chaste in its way that Úrsula ceased her vigilance.<br />皮埃特罗·克雷斯皮回来修理自动钢琴了。丽贝卡和阿玛兰塔帮他理顺琴弦，旋律中混杂着她们的笑声。场面如此的愉悦有礼节，于是乌尔苏拉便放下了警觉。

On the eve of his departure a farewell dance for him was improvised with the pianola and with Rebeca he put on a skillful demonstration of modern dance, Arcadio and Amaranta matched them in grace and skill. But the exhibition was interrupted because Pilar Ternera, who was at the door with the onlookers, had a fight, biting and hair pulling, with a woman who had dared to comment that Arcadio had a woman's behind.<br />离开前夕，在自动钢琴的伴奏下为其准备了一场告别舞会。他和丽贝卡联袂表演了一段美妙的现代舞，阿尔卡蒂奥与阿玛兰塔在优雅与技巧上和他们不相上下。但是表演因为皮拉尔·特尔内拉而被中断，她在门口与围观者打了起来，又是咬又是拉扯头发，只因有个女人竟然妄言阿尔卡蒂奥长着女人的屁股。

Toward midnight Pietro Crespi took his leave with a sentimental little speech, and he promised to return very soon. Rebeca accompanied him to the door, and having closed up the house and put out the lamps, she went to her room to weep. It was an inconsolable weeping that lasted for several days, the cause of which was not known even by Amaranta. Her hermetism was not odd. Although she seemed expansive and cordial, she had a solitary character an impenetrable heart.<br />午夜时分，皮埃特罗·克雷斯皮带着伤感的简短发言离开了马孔多，他承诺很快就会回来。丽贝卡送他到门口，随后关上门，熄灭了灯，在自己的房间哭泣。悲痛欲绝地持续了好几天，其原因甚至阿玛兰塔都不知晓。她的守口如瓶并不奇怪，尽管她看上去友善而亲切，实际却性格孤僻，内心不可捉摸。
 
She was a splendid adolescent with long and firm bones, but she still insisted on using the small wooden rocking chair with which she had arrived at the house, reinforced many times and with the arms gone. No one had discovered that even at that age she still had the habit of sucking her finger. That was why she would not lose an opportunity to lock herself in the bathroom and had acquired the habit of sleeping with her face to the wall.<br />她是一个出色的少女，身材修长，体格结实，但她仍然喜欢坐在和她一起到来的小木头摇椅上，摇椅加固了很多次，扶手都没了。没有人发现即使在这个年龄，他任然有吮吸手指的习惯。这就是为什么她从不会错失把自己锁在浴室的机会，还养成了面对着墙壁睡觉的习惯。

On rainy afternoons, embroidering with a group of friends on the begonia porch, she would lose the thread of the conversation and a tear of nostalgia would salt her palate when she saw the strips of damp earth and the piles of mud that the earthworms had pushed up in the garden. Those secret tastes, defeated in the past by oranges and rhubarb, broke out into an irrepressible urge when she began to weep. She went back to eating earth. The first time she did it almost out of curiosity, sure that the bad taste would be the best cure for the temptation.<br />一个雨天的下午，她和一群朋友们在秋海棠长廊刺绣。每当看到花园里潮湿的泥土和蚯蚓堆起的土堆，她总会从交谈中走神，怀旧的泪水带着咸味划过嘴角。她开始哭泣，这隐秘的味道曾经被橙汁和大黄打败，她又开始吃土了。第一次几乎是出于好奇，并确信这糟糕的味道是摆脱诱惑最好的疗法。

And, in fact, she could not bear the earth in her mouth. But she persevered, overcome by the growing anxiety, and little by little she was getting back her ancestral appetite, the taste primary minerals, the unbridled satisfaction of what was the original food. She would put handfuls of earth in her pockets, and ate them in small bits without being seen, with a confused feeling of pleasure and rage, as she instructed her girl friends in the most difficult needlepoint and spoke about other men, who did not deserve the sacrifice of having one eat the whitewash on the walls because of them.<br />事实上，她无法忍受嘴中泥土的味道，但仍然坚持着，最后被日益增长的焦虑打败，逐渐地恢复了以往的食欲，对矿物质的喜爱，无限满足于原始食物。她将一把土兜在口袋里，然后趁人不注意以一种愉悦又愤怒的感觉，一点一点地吃掉，一边教授朋友们最复杂的针绣，一边讨论那些男人，不值得因为他们而放弃吃墙石灰。

The handfuls of earth made the only man who deserved that show of degradation less remote and more certain, as if the ground that he walked on with his fine patent leather boots in another part the world were transmitting to her the weight and the temperature his blood in a mineral savor that left a harsh aftertaste in her mouth and a sediment of peace in her heart. One afternoon, for no reason, Amparo Moscote asked permission to see the house. Amaranta and Rebeca, disconcerted by the unexpected visit, attended her with a stiff formality. They showed her the remodeled mansion, they had her listen to the rolls on the pianola, and they offered her orange marmalade and crackers.<br />这一把泥土使得那唯一让她堕落的男人近在咫尺，真真切切，仿佛从他脚上精巧的漆皮靴在世界另一处所踏的土地传来矿物的味道，传递出了他的体重和血液的温热，这感觉在她口中留下强烈的余味，内心沉淀平和。一天下午，安帕罗·摩斯科特无缘无故请求参观新房子，阿玛兰塔和丽贝卡因突如其来的造访感到困惑不安，以拘谨的礼节接待了她。她们向她介绍了装修后的宅第，邀请她听自动钢琴的演奏，还为她提供了橘子酱和饼干。

Amparo gave a lesson in dignity, personal charm, and good manners that impressed Úrsula in the few moments that she was present during the visit. After two hours, when the conversation was beginning to wane, Amparo took advantage of Amaranta's distraction and gave Rebeca a letter. She was able to see the name of the Estimable Señorita Rebeca Buendía, written in the same methodical hand, with the same green ink, and the same delicacy of words with which the instructions for the operation of the pianola were written, and she folded the letter with the tips of her fingers and hid it in her bosom, looking at Amparo Moscote with an expression of endless and unconditional gratitude and a silent promise of complicity unto death.<br />安帕罗给她们上了一堂关于体面、个人魅力以及礼仪的课程，给在场才一会儿的乌尔苏拉留下深刻印象。两小时后，谈话逐渐减弱，安帕罗趁着阿玛兰塔走神之际，偷偷地将一封信塞给了丽贝卡。她看到称呼写着“尊敬的丽贝卡·布恩迪亚小姐”，使用与自动钢琴操作指南上同样的精致字体，以及同样的绿色墨水，文辞雅致。她用指尖折起信件藏在怀里，眼中充满着无尽的感激之情望着安帕罗·摩斯科特，两人悄悄地结下了生死之友的盟约。

The sudden friendship between Amparo Moscote and Rebeca Buendía awakened the hopes of Aureliano. The memory of little Remedios had not stopped tormenting him, but he had not found a chance to see her. When he would stroll through town his closest friends, Magnífico Visbal and Gerineldo Márquez-the sons of the founders of the same names-he would look for her in the sewing shop with an anxious glance, but he saw only the older sisters.<br />安帕罗·摩斯科特和丽贝卡·布恩迪亚之间突然的友谊唤醒了奥雷里亚诺的希望，对小蕾梅黛丝的念念不忘无时无刻不折磨着他，却一直没有机会见她。当他跟最亲密的朋友马可尼菲克·维斯巴尔和杰里内尔多·马尔克斯——马孔多创始人的儿子们，父子同名，一起在镇上闲逛，他在裁缝铺里急切地搜寻着她，但只看到了她的姐姐们。

The presence of Amparo Moscote in the house was like a premonition. "She has to come with her," Aureliano would say to himself in a low voice. "She has to come." He repeated it so many times and with such conviction that one afternoon when he was putting together a little gold fish in the work shop, he had the certainty that she had answered his call. Indeed, a short time later he heard the childish voice, when he looked up his heart froze with terror as he saw the girl at the door, dressed in pink organdy and wearing white boots.<br />家里安帕罗·摩斯科特的光临像是一个预兆。“她一定会跟她一起来，”奥雷里亚诺低声地自言自语。“她一定会跟她一起来。”他怀着坚定的信念重复着无数次。终于一天下午，他在作坊里组装一条小金鱼时，感觉到她回应了自己的呼唤。的确不久后他听到了她幼稚的声音，抬头便看到那个女孩站在门口，穿着粉色丝纱和白色靴子，心脏因惊恐而凝固。

"You can't go in there, Remedios, " Amparo Moscote said from the hall. "They're working."<br />“你不能进去，蕾梅黛丝，”从走廊传来安帕罗·摩斯科特的声音，“他们在工作。”

But Aureliano did not give her time to respond. He picked up the little fish by the chain that came through its mouth and said to her：<br />但是奥雷里亚诺没有给她反应的时间，他抓起一条口中串着链子的小金鱼对她说：

"Come in."<br />“进来吧。”

Remedios went over and asked some questions about the fish that Aureliano could not answer because he was seized with a sudden attack of asthma. He wanted to stay beside that lily skin forever, beside those emerald eyes, close to that voice that called him "sir" with every question. showing the same respect that she gave her father.<br />蕾梅黛丝走了过去，问了一些关于小金鱼的问题，奥雷里亚诺没能回答，因为他猝然间喘不过气来。她那百合般的皮肤和绿宝石般的眼睛，他想永远这样待在她旁边，聆听她每问一个问题都叫他一声“先生”，像尊敬自己父亲一样尊敬他。

Melquíades was in the corner seated at the desk scribbling indecipherable signs. Aureliano hated him. All he could do was tell Remedios that he was going to give her the little fish and the girl was so startled by the offer that she left the workshop as fast as she could. That afternoon Aureliano lost the hidden patience with which he had waited for a chance to see her.<br />梅尔基亚德斯坐在角落里的书桌上，信手画着无人能懂的符号。奥雷里亚诺讨厌他，他能做的就是告诉蕾梅黛丝要把小金鱼送给她，蕾梅黛丝被他的提议吓得飞快地离开了作坊。那天下午，奥雷里亚诺失去了隐藏于心苦苦等待机会去见她的耐心。

He neglected his work. In several desperate efforts of concentration he willed her to appear but Remedios did not respond. He looked for her in sisters' shop, behind the window shades in her house, in her father's office, but he found her only in the image that saturated his private and terrible solitude.<br />他无心工作，几次竭尽全力地专注，他希望她出现，但是蕾梅黛丝没有回应。他在她姐姐们的店里寻找她，在她家窗前寻找她，在她父亲的办公室寻找她，但他只能在印象中找到她，填满了他隐秘而可怕的孤独。

He would spend whole hours with Rebeca in the parlor listening to the music on the pianola. She was listening to it because it was the music with which Pietro Crespi had taught them how to dance. Aureliano listened to it simply because everything, even music, reminded him of Remedios.<br />他整整一个小时和丽贝卡坐在客厅，聆听自动钢琴弹奏的音乐。丽贝卡这么做是因为这首音乐是皮埃特罗·克雷斯皮教她们如何跳舞的音乐，而奥雷里亚诺这么做仅仅是因为一切，甚至音乐，都会让他想起蕾梅黛丝。

The house became full of loves Aureliano expressed it in poetry that had no beginning or end. He would write it on the harsh pieces of parchment that Melquíades gave him, on the bathroom walls, on the skin of his arms, and in all of it Remedios would appear transfigured: Remedios in the soporific air two in the afternoon, Remedios in the soft breath of the roses, Remedios in the water-clock secrets of the moths, Remedios in the steaming morning bread, Remedios everywhere and Remedios forever.<br />家里变得充满了爱的气息，奥雷里亚诺借助于无头无尾的诗歌表达爱意，他把诗写在梅尔基亚德斯送给他的粗糙的羊皮纸上，写在浴室的墙上，写在手臂的皮肤上，所有的诗句里蕾梅黛丝都会改容换貌的出现：蕾梅黛丝出现在下午两点令人昏昏欲睡的空气中，蕾梅黛丝出现在玫瑰花的柔和气息中，蕾梅黛丝出现在隐秘的蛀虫蛀蚀后的沙漏中，蕾梅黛丝出现在清晨腾腾的面包热气中，蕾梅黛丝无时无刻，无处不在。

Rebeca waited for her love at four in the afternoon, embroidering by the window. She knew that the mailman's mule arrived only every two weeks, but she always waited for him, convinced that he was going to arrive on some other day by mistake. It happened quite the opposite: once the mule did not come on the usual day. Mad desperation, Rebeca got up in the middle of the night and ate handfuls of earth in the garden with a suicidal drive, weeping with pain and fury, chewing tender earthworms and chipping her teeth on snail shells. She vomited until dawn.<br />下午四点丽贝卡在窗前绣花，等待着她的情书。她知道邮递员的骡子每两周来一次，但她依旧每天等待着，并坚信他们会出现差错，任何一天都有可能到达。然而事与愿违，如期的日子骡子并没有到达，丽贝卡疯狂且绝望，半夜爬起床，在自杀倾向的驱使下，一抔一抔地吃花园里的泥土，痛苦愤怒地哭泣，咀嚼着柔软的蚯蚓，蜗牛壳磕坏了她的牙齿，呕吐到天亮。

She fell into a state of feverish prostration, lost consciousness, and her heart went into a shameless delirium. Úrsula, scandalized, forced the lock on her trunk and found at the bottom, tied together with pink ribbons, the sixteen perfumed letters and the skeletons of leaves and petals preserved in old books the dried butterflies that turned to powder at the touch.<br />她陷入一种焦虑不安的虚脱状态，神志不清，肆无忌惮地胡言乱语。大为震惊的乌尔苏拉强行撬开了她的行李箱，发现了藏在箱底扎着粉色丝带的十六封芬芳馥郁的信件，以及保存在旧书中完整的叶子和花瓣，以及一碰就碎的蝴蝶标本。

Aureliano was the only one capable of understanding such desolation. That afternoon, while Úrsula was trying to rescue Rebeca from the slough of delirium, he went with Magnífico Visbal and Gerineldo Márquez to Catarino's store. The establishment had been expanded with a gallery of wooden rooms where single women who smelled of dead flowers lived.<br />奥雷里亚诺是唯一一个能够理解这种忧伤的人。那天下午，在乌尔苏拉试图将丽贝卡从神志不清的苦难深渊中解救出来的时候，他与马可尼菲克·维斯巴尔和杰里内尔多·马尔克斯去了卡塔林诺的店里。该旅馆已经被扩展为一排的木制房间，里面居住的单身女子散发着凋谢的花朵气味。

A group made up of an accordion and drums played the songs of Francisco the Man, who had not been seen in Macondo for several years. The three friends drank fermented cane juice. Magnífico Gerineldo, contemporaries of Aureliano but more skilled in the ways of the world, drank methodically with the women seated on their laps. One of the women, withered and with goldwork on her teeth, gave Aureliano a caress that made him shudder.<br />一个由手风琴和鼓组成的乐团正在演奏好汉弗朗西斯科的歌谣，他已经多年不曾出现在马孔多了。好友三人喝着酿制甘蔗汁，马可尼菲克与杰里内尔多跟奥雷里亚诺虽是同龄人，却更精通于处世之道，纵有女人坐在腿上依旧有条不紊地喝着酒。其中一个女人形容枯槁，嘴里镶着金牙，抚摸着奥雷里亚诺，使他一阵战栗。

He rejected her. He had discovered that the more he drank the more he thought about Remedios, but he could bear the torture of his recollections better. He did not know exactly when he began to float. He saw his friends and the women sailing in a radiant glow, without weight or mass, saying words that did not come out of their mouths and making mysterious signals that did not correspond to their expressions.<br />他拒绝了她，他发现酒喝得越多，就越想念蕾梅黛丝，但似乎也能够承受住回忆的煎熬。不知何时他开始觉得自己轻飘飘的，看见朋友们和女人在耀眼的灯光中轻盈朦胧地晃动，他们所说的话，仿佛不是从他们嘴里发出来的，以及和他们表情不相契合的奇怪手势。

Catarino put a hand on his shoulder and said to him: "It's going on eleven." Aureliano turned his head, saw the enormous disfigured face with a felt flower behind the ear, and then he lost his memory, as during the times of forgetfulness, and he recovered it on a strange dawn and in a room that was completely foreign, where Pilar Ternera stood in her slip, barefoot, her hair down, holding a lamp over him, startled with disbelief.<br />卡塔林诺把手搭在他的肩上，对他说：“快十一点了。”奥雷里亚诺扭过头，看见一张又大又丑的脸，耳朵后别着一只毡花，随后就像失忆症时期那样失去了意识，昏迷过去。再次醒来时已是清晨，身处一个完全陌生的房间。皮拉尔·特尔内拉穿着衬衫，光着脚，披头散发，在他头顶举着台灯，难以置信地尖叫了一声：

"Aureliano!"<br />“是你，奥雷里亚诺！”

Aureliano checked his feet and raised his head. He did not know how he had come there, but he knew what his aim was, because he had carried it hidden since infancy in an inviolable backwater of his heart.<br />奥雷里亚诺稳了稳脚跟，抬起头，他不知道自己怎么到这的，但他清楚自己的目的，因为他从小就把这个目的深藏在内心深处。

"I've come to sleep with you," he said.<br />“我是来和你睡觉的，”他说。

His clothes were smeared with mud and vomit. Pilar Ternera, who lived alone at that time with her two younger children, did not ask him any questions. She took him to the bed. She cleaned his face with a damp cloth, took of his clothes, and then got completely undressed and lowered the mosquito netting so that her children would not see them if they woke up.<br />他的衣服上沾满了泥土和呕吐物。皮拉尔·特尔内拉此时独自和两个孩子生活在一起，她什么也没问，把他带到床上，用湿布清洗他的脸，脱掉他的衣服，然后自己也脱得一干二净，她放下蚊帐，免得孩子醒来看见他们。

She had become tired of waiting for the man who would stay, of the men who left, of the countless men who missed the road to her house, confused by the uncertainty of the cards. During the wait her skin had become wrinkled, her breasts had withered, the coals of her heart had gone out.<br />她已经厌倦了等待，等待留下的男人，等待离开的男人，等待无数因纸牌飘忽不定而的预测迷失归程的男人，无尽的等待中，他的皮肤泛起了皱纹，乳房干瘪萎缩，心中的焰火渐渐熄灭。

She felt for Aureliano in the darkness, put her hand on his stomach and kissed him on the neck with a maternal tenderness. "My poor child," she murmured. Aureliano shuddered. With a calm skill, without the slightest misstep, he left his accumulated grief behind and found Remedios changed into a swamp without horizons, smelling of a raw animal and recently ironed clothes. When he came to the surface he was weeping.<br />黑暗中她抚摸着奥雷里亚诺，把手放在他的肚子上，母亲般慈爱地亲吻着他的脖子。“我可怜的孩子，”她喃喃道。奥雷里亚诺颤抖起来，他以沉着冷静、毫无过失的技巧，将自己蓄积已久的悲伤抛诸脑后，发现蕾梅黛丝变成了无边无际的沼泽，闻起来有股原始动物和刚熨烫好的衣服的气息。当他浮出水面时，他哭了起来。

First they were involuntary and broken sobs. Then he emptied himself out in an unleashed flow, feeling that something swollen and painful had burst inside of him. She waited, snatching his head with the tips fingers, until his body got rid of the dark material that would not let him live. Then Pilar Ternera asked him: "Who is it?" And Aureliano told her. She let out a laugh that in other times frightened the doves and that now did not even wake up the children.<br />开始是不由自主地抽泣，接着便泪如雨下，体内的郁结和痛苦土本瓦解。她等待着，用指尖按摩他的头，直到他摆脱体内使其痛不欲生的未知物质。皮拉尔·特尔内拉问他：“她是谁？”奥雷里亚诺知无不言。她放声大笑，以前足以惊飞鸽群的笑声，现在甚至都没有吵醒孩子们。

"You'll have to raise her first," she mocked, but underneath the mockery Aureliano found a reservoir of understanding. When he went out of the room, leaving behind not only his doubts about his virility but also the bitter weight that his heart had borne for so many months, Pilar Ternera made him a spontaneous promise.<br />她嘲笑道：“你首先得抚养她长大。”嘲笑之余，奥雷里亚诺找到了理解的源泉。当他走出房间时，不仅打消了对自己性能力的怀疑，还放下了心头长达数月的重负。皮拉尔·特尔内拉给了他一个承诺。

"I'm going to talk to the girl," she told him, "and you'll see what I'll serve her on the tray."<br />“我去跟那女孩谈谈，”她告诉他，“你将看到我会为她竭诚服务。”

She kept her promise. But it was a bad moment, because the house had lost its peace of former days. When she discovered Rebeca's passion, which was impossible to keep secret because of her shouts, Amaranta suffered an attack of fever. She also suffered from the barb of a lonely love. Shut up in the bathroom, she would release herself from the torment of a hopeless passion by writing feverish letters, which she finally hid in the bottom of her trunk.<br />她信守诺言，只是时机不对，因为家里已经失去了往日的宁静。丽贝卡强烈的爱意，因为她情不自禁地呼喊不胫而走，阿玛兰塔因此生病发烧了。孤独的爱情犹如丽贝卡心中的倒刺，她把自己关在浴室，写着深情的书信，借此摆脱绝望爱情的折磨，然后把书信藏在行李箱的箱底。

Úrsula barely had the strength to take care of the two sick girls. She was unable, after prolonged and insidious interrogations, to ascertain the causes of Amaranta's prostration. Finally, in another moment of inspiration, she forced the lock on the trunk and found the letters tied with a pink ribbon, swollen with fresh lilies and still wet with tears, addressed and never sent to Pietro Crespi.<br />乌尔苏拉几乎没有精力同时照顾两个生病的女孩，长时间旁敲侧击地盘问，依旧无法查明阿玛兰塔日渐虚弱的原因。最后突然灵机一动，她撬开了丽贝卡的行李箱，发现了系着粉色丝带的信件，信中塞满新鲜的百合花，信上泪痕未干，却始终没有寄给皮埃特罗·克雷斯皮。

Weeping with rage, she cursed the day that it had occurred to her to buy the pianola, she forbade the embroidery lessons and decreed a kind of mourning with no one dead which was to be prolonged until the daughters got over their hopes. Useless was the intervention of José Arcadio Buendía, who had modified his first impression Pietro Crespi and admired his ability in the manipulation of musical machines.<br />乌尔苏拉饱含愤怒的泪水，在心里咒骂自己那天为什么要买自动钢琴。她取消了刺绣课程，决定无限期进入服丧期，即使没有人去世，直到女儿们断了她们的念想。何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚对皮埃特罗·克雷斯皮的最初印象有所改观，欣赏他操作音乐机器上的才能。试图干预，却无济于事。

So that when Pilar Ternera told Aureliano that Remedios had decided on marriage, he could see that the news would only give his parents more trouble. Invited to the parlor for a formal interview, José Arcadio Buendía and Úrsula listened stonily to their son's declaration. When he learned the name of the fiancée, however, José Arcadio Buendía grew red with indignation. "Love is a disease," he thundered. "With so many pretty and decent girls around, the only thing that occurs to you is to get married to the daughter of our enemy."<br />因此，当皮拉尔·特尔内拉告诉奥雷里亚诺：蕾梅黛丝已经决定结婚时，他知道这个消息只会给父母带来更多的麻烦。何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚和乌尔苏拉被邀请到客厅做了一个正式的面谈，冷漠地听着儿子的声明。当听到未婚妻的名字时，何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚勃然变色，“爱情是瘟疫，”他喊道。“周围有那么多端庄贤淑的女孩，你却偏偏要娶敌人的女儿。”

But Úrsula agreed the choice. She confessed her affection for the seven Moscote sisters. for their beauty, their ability for work, their modesty, and their good manners, and she celebrated her son's prudence. Conquered by his wife's enthusiasm, José Arcadio Buendía then laid down one condition: Rebeca, who was the one he wanted, would marry Pietro Crespi. Úrsula would take Amaranta on a trip to the capital of the province when she had time, so that contact with different people would alleviate her disappointment.<br />然而乌尔苏拉十分赞许儿子的抉择，承认自己对摩斯科特家七姐妹有好感。因为她们漂亮，能干，谦逊，彬彬有礼。称赞儿子有眼光。何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚难却妻子的热情，只提了一个条件：他希望丽贝卡可以嫁给皮埃特罗·克雷斯皮。乌尔苏拉将抽个空带着阿玛兰塔去省会旅旅游，接触接触不同的人，以减轻她内心的失望之情。

Rebeca got her health back just as soon as she heard of the agreement, and she wrote her fiancé a jubilant letter that she submitted to her parents' approval and put into the mail without the use of any intermediaries. Amaranta pretended to accept the decision and little by little she recovered from her fevers, but she promised herself that Rebeca would marry only over her dead body.<br />丽贝卡一听到这个商定，身体立马便好转了。在父母的同意下，她写信将这个好消息告诉了她的未婚夫，并且没有任何人干预直接就寄给了他。阿玛兰塔假装接受了这个决定，逐渐从发烧中康复，但她暗暗发誓：丽贝卡想要结婚，除非从自己的尸体上踏过去。

The following Saturday José Arcadio Buendía put on his dark suit, his celluloid collar, and the deerskin boots that he had worn for the first time the night of the party, and went to ask for the hand of Remedios Moscote. The magistrate and his wife received him, pleased and worried at the same time, for they did not know the reason for the unexpected visit, and then they thought that he was confused about the name of the intended bride.<br />接下来的星期六，何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚套上他的黑色西装，戴上赛璐珞衣领，穿上宴会那夜第一次穿的鹿皮靴，便去找蕾梅黛丝·摩斯科特为儿子提亲。镇长和他的妻子既高兴又不安，一起接待了他，不知道他意外到访的原因，然后他们认为他弄混了新娘的名字。

In order to remove the mistake, the mother woke Remedios up and carried her into the living room, still drowsy from sleep. They asked her if it was true that she had decided to get married, and she answered, whimpering, that she only wanted them to let her sleep. José Arcadio Buendía, understanding the distress of the Moscotes, went to clear things up with Aureliano. When he returned, the Moscotes had put on formal clothing, had rearranged the furniture put fresh flowers in the vases, and were waiting in the company of their older daughters.<br />为了消除误解，母亲叫醒了蕾梅黛丝，并把她带到客厅，仍然是一副睡眼惺忪的样子。他们问她是否真的决定要结婚，她抽搭着说她只想睡觉。何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚理解摩斯科特夫妇的忧虑，便去找奥雷里亚诺把事情弄清楚。当他返回来的时候，莫斯科特夫妇已经穿好了正装，重新布置了家具，在花瓶中插上了鲜花，他们的大女儿也一起陪同等候。

Overwhelmed by the unpleasantness of the occasion and the bothersome hard collar, José Arcadio Buendía confirmed the fact that Remedios, indeed, was the chosen one. "It doesn't make sense," Don Apolinar Moscote said with consternation. "We have six other daughters, all unmarried, and at an age where they deserve it, who would be delighted to be the honorable wife of a gentleman as serious and hardworking as your son, and Aureliano to lays his eyes precisely on the one who still wets her bed." His wife, a well-preserved woman with afflicted eyelids and expression, scolded his mistake.<br />尴尬的场合以及恼人的坚硬衣领让何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚不知所措，但他坚信一个事实：蕾梅黛丝的确是奥雷里亚诺所选之人。“这没有道理啊，”堂·阿波利纳尔·摩斯科特不安地说着。“我还有另外六个女儿，都到了适婚年龄，尚未婚配，她们很高兴成为像您儿子这样勤劳又稳重的绅士的妻子，而奥雷里亚诺偏偏要将目光投向仍然还在尿床的那一个。”她的妻子是一个保养得很好的女人，眼神和表情中带着一丝悲伤，训斥了丈夫的无礼。

When they finished the fruit punch, they willingly accepted Aureliano's decision. Except that Señora Moscote begged the favor of speaking to Úrsula alone. Intrigued, protesting that they were involving her in men's affairs, but really feeling deep emotion, Úrsula went to visit her the next day. A half hour later she returned with the news that Remedios had not reached puberty. Aureliano did not consider that a serious barrier. He had waited so long that he could wait as long as was necessary until his bride reached the age of conception.<br />他们喝完果汁饮料，欣然地接受了奥雷里亚诺的决定，不过摩斯科特太太请求与乌尔苏拉单独谈谈。乌尔苏拉很感兴趣，又抗议他们将自己卷入了男人们的事情。但真情流露，第二天便去拜访她，半个小时后她带着蕾梅黛丝还未到青春期的消息回来了，但奥雷里亚诺并不认为这是一个严峻的障碍。他已经等待了很久，如果有必要他可以一直等下去，直到新娘达到可以怀孕的年龄。

The newfound harmony was interrupted by the death of Melquíades. Although it was a foreseeable event, the circumstances were not. A few months after his return, a process aging had taken place in him that was so rapid and critical that soon he was treated as one of those useless great-grandfathers who wander about the bedrooms like shades, dragging their feet, remembering better times aloud, and whom no one bothers about or remembers really until the morning they find them dead in their bed.<br />短暂的宁静被梅尔基亚德斯的去世打破了。尽管预料之中，但情况并非如此。他回来几个月后，经历了一次急剧而严重的衰老过程，很快就被视为不中用的曾祖父辈中的一员，他们像幽灵一样拖着步子在卧室中游荡，大声追忆美好时光，依旧无人理睬或者想起他，直到清晨他们才发现他死在了床上。

At first José Arcadio Buendía helped him in his work, enthusiastic over the novelty of the daguerreotypes and the predictions of Nostradamus. But little by little he began abandoning him to his solitude, for communication was becoming Increasingly difficult. He was losing his sight and his hearing, he seemed to confuse the people he was speaking to with others he had known in remote epochs of mankind, and he would answer questions with a complex hodgepodge languages.<br />起初，何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚在其工作上给予帮助，对达盖尔银版照片的新奇和诺查丹玛斯的预言充满了热情。由于交流日益困难，他渐渐的被疏远，孤独一身。耳聋眼花，似乎把跟他聊天的人当成他理解的远古时代的人类，回答问题时使用复杂的混合语言。

He would walk along groping in the air, although he passed between objects with an inexplicable fluidity, as if be were endowed with some instinct of direction based on an immediate prescience. One day he forgot to put in his false teeth, which at night he left in a glass of water beside his bed, and he never put them in again. When Úrsula undertook the enlargement of the house, she had them build him a special room next to Aureliano's workshop, far from the noise and bustle of the house, with a window flooded with light and a bookcase where she herself put in order the books that were almost destroyed by dust and moths, the flaky stacks of paper covered with indecipherable signs, and the glass with his false teeth, where some aquatic plants with tiny yellow flowers had taken root.<br />他摸索着前行，尽管在物体间穿梭自由，仿佛被赋予了某种基于即时预知的方向感。有一天，他忘了戴上晚上放在床边水杯里的假牙，之后便再也没有戴过它。当时乌尔苏拉扩建房屋，她命令工匠在奥雷里亚诺的作坊旁边为梅尔基亚德斯建了一间单独的房间，远离家里的喧嚣与叨扰。一个阳光充沛的窗户，还有一个书架，上面排列着乌尔苏拉整理的被灰尘和蠹虫破坏得几乎残败不堪的书籍，一堆画满了难以辨别的符号的薄纸片和装着假牙的杯子，杯子里长出了水生植物，开着黄色的小花。

The new place seemed to please Melquíades, because he was never seen any more, not even in the dining room, He only went to Aureliano's workshop, where he would spend hours on end scribbling his enigmatic literature on the parchments that he had brought with him and that seemed to have been made out of some dry material that crumpled like puff paste. There he ate the meals that Visitación brought him twice a day, although in the last days he lost his appetite and fed only on vegetables.<br />新居所甚得其心，因为之后再也没有看见他了，即使在餐厅。他只去奥雷里亚诺的作坊，在那里他花上数小时在随身携带的羊皮纸上写着神秘的文字，羊皮纸由某些干燥的材料制成，皱得像千层酥面团。他在那吃由维希塔西恩每天两次送去的食物，最后几天他食欲不振，只吃蔬菜。

He soon acquired the forlorn look that one sees in vegetarians. His skin became covered with a thin moss, similar to that which flourished on the antique vest that he never took off, and his breath exhaled the odor of a sleeping animal. Aureliano ended up forgetting about him, absorbed in the composition of his poems, but on one occasion he thought he understood something of what Melquíades was saying in his groping monologues, and he paid attention.<br />很快他便显现出素食者特有的孤独凄凉的模样，皮肤上长满了一层薄薄的苔藓，与身上那件从未脱下的老旧坎肩上滋生的相仿。鼻息中散发出沉睡动物的气味。奥雷里亚诺最终忽略了他的存在，专心致志于他的诗作，但有一次他感觉理解了梅尔基亚德斯在摸索行走时的只言片语，便留心注意。

In reality, the only thing that could be isolated in the rocky paragraphs was the insistent hammering on the word equinox, equinox, equinox, and the name of Alexander von Humboldt. Arcadio got a little closer to him when he began to help Aureliano in his silverwork. Melquíades answered that effort at communication at times by giving forth with phrases in Spanish that had very little to do reality. One afternoon, however, he seemed to be illuminated by a sudden emotion.<br />实际上，

Years later, facing the firing squad, Arcadio would remember the trembling with which Melquíades made him listen to several pages of his impenetrable writing, which course he did not understand, but which when read aloud were like encyclicals being chanted. Then he smiled for the first time in a long while and said in Spanish: "When I die, burn mercury in my room for three days." Arcadßo told that to José Arcadio Buendía and the latter tried to get more explicit information, but he received only one answer: "I have found immortality." When Melquíades' breathing began to smell, Arcadio took him to bathe in the river on Thursday mornings.<br />

He seemed to get better. He would undress and get into the water with the boys, and his mysterious sense of orientation would allow him to avoid the deep and dangerous spots. "We come from the water," he said on a certain occasion. Much time passed in that way without anyone's seeing him in the house except on the night when he made a pathetic effort to fix the pianola, and when he would go to the river with Arcadio, carrying under his arm a gourd and a bar of palm oil soap wrapped in a towel.<br />

One Thursday before they called him to go to the river, Aureliano heard him say: "I have died of fever on the dunes of Singapore." That day he went into the water at a bad spot and they did not find him until the following day, a few miles downstream, washed up on a bright bend in the river and with a solitary vulture sitting on his stomach. Over the scandalized protests of Úrsula, who wept with more grief than she had had for her own father, José Arcadio Buendía was opposed to their burying him. "He is immortal," he said, "and he himself revealed the formula of his resurrection."<br />

He brought out the forgotten water pipe and put a kettle mercury to boil next to the body, which little by little was filling with blue bubbles. Don Apolinar Moscote ventured to remind him that an unburied drowned man was a danger to public health. "None of that, because he's alive," was the answer of José Arcadio Buendía, who finished the seventy-two hours with the mercurial incense as the body was already beginning to burst with a livid fluorescence, the soft whistles of which impregnated the house with a pestilential vapor.<br />

Only then did he permit them to bury him, not in any ordinary way, but the honors reserved for Macondo's greatest benefactor. It was the first burial and the best-attended one that was ever seen in the town, only surpassed, a century later, by Big Mama's funeral carnival. They buried him in a grave dug in the center of the plot destined for the cemetery, with a stone on which they wrote the only thing they knew about him: MELQUíADES. They gave him his nine nights of wake. In the tumult that gathered in the courtyard to drink coffee, tell jokes, and play cards.<br />

Amaranta found a chance to confess her love to Pietro Crespi, who a few weeks before had formalized his promise to Rebeca and had set up a store for musical instruments and mechanical toys in the same section where the Arabs had lingered in other times swapping knickknacks for macaws, and which the people called the Street of the Turks. The Italian, whose head covered with patent leather curls aroused in women an irrepressible need to sigh, dealt with Amaranta as with a capricious little girl who was not worth taking seriously.<br />

"I have a younger brother," he told her. "He's coming to help me in the store."<br />

Amaranta felt humiliated and told Pietro Crespi with a virulent anger that she was prepared to stop her sister's wedding even own dead body had to lie across the door. The Italian was so impressed by the dramatics of the threat that he could not resist the temptation to mention it to Rebeca. That was how Amaranta's trip, always put off by Úrsula's work, was arranged in less than a week. Amaranta put up no resistance, but when she kissed Rebeca goodbye she whispered in her ear:<br />

"Don't get your hopes up. Even if they send me to the ends of the earth I'll find some way of stopping you from getting married, even if I have to kill you."<br />

With the absence of Úrsula, with the invisible presence of Melquíades, who continued his stealthy shuffling through the rooms, the house seemed enormous and empty. Rebeca took charge of domestic order, while the Indian woman took care of the bakery. At dusk, when Pietro Crespi would arrive, preceded by a cool breath of lavender and always bringing a toy as a gift, his fiancée would receive the visitor in the main parlor with doors and windows open to be safe from any suspicion.<br />

It was an unnecessary precaution, for the Italian had shown himself to be so respectful that he did not even touch the hand of the woman who was going to be his wife within the year. Those visits were filling the house with remarkable toys. Mechanical ballerinas, music boxes, acrobatic monkeys, trotting horses, clowns who played the tambourine: the rich and startling mechanical fauna that Pietro Crespi brought dissipated José Arcadio Buendía's affliction over the death of Melquíades and carried him back to his old days as an alchemist.<br />

He lived at that time in a paradise of disemboweled animals, of mechanisms that had been taken apart in an attempt to perfect them with a system of perpetual motion based upon the principles of the pendulum. Aureliano, for his part, had neglected the workshop in order to teach little Remedios to read and write. At first the child preferred her dolls to the man who would come every afternoon and who was responsi-ble for her being separated from her toys in order to be bathed and dressed and seated in the parlor to receive the visitor.<br />

But Aureliano's patience and devotion final-ly won her over, up to the point where she would spend many hours with him studying the meaning of the letters and sketching in a notebook with colored pencils little houses with cows in the corral and round suns with yellow rays that hid behind the hills.<br />

"You will not be happy as long as your parents remain unburied."<br />

Rebeca shuddered. As in the memory of a dream she saw herself entering the house as a very small girl, with the trunk and the little rocker, a bag whose contents she had never known. She remembered a bald gentleman dressed in linen and with his collar closed by a gold button, who had nothing to do with the king of hearts. She remembered a very young and beautiful woman with warm and perfumed hands, who had nothing in common with the jack of diamonds and his rheumatic hands, who used to put flowers in her hair and take her out walking in the afternoon through a town with green streets.<br />

"I don't understand," she said.<br />

Pilar Ternera seemed disconcerted:<br />

"I don't either, but that's what the cards say."<br />

Rebeca was so preoccupied the enigma that she told it to José Arcadio Buendía, and he scolded her for believing in the predictions of the cards, but he undertook the silent task of searching closets and trunks, moving furniture and turning over beds and floorboards looking for the bag of bones. He remembered that he had not seen it since the time of the rebuilding. He secretly summoned the masons and one of them revealed that he had walled up the bag in some bedroom because it bothered him in his work.<br />

After several days of listening, with their ears against the walls, they perceived the deep cloccloc. They penetrated the wall and there were the bones in the intact bag. They buried it the same day in a grave without a stone next to that of Melquíades, and José Arcadio Buendía returned home free of a burden that for a moment had weighed on his conscience as much as the memory of Prudencio Aguilar. When he went through the kitchen he kissed Rebeca on the forehead.<br />

The friendship with Rebeca opened up to Pilar Ternera the doors of the house, closed by Úrsula since the birth of Arcadio. She would arrive at any hour of the day, like a flock of goats, and would unleash her feverish energy in the hardest tasks. Sometimes she would go into the workshop and help Arcadio sensitize the daguerreotype plates with an efficiency and a tenderness that ended up by confusing him. That woman bothered him. The tan of her skin, her smell of smoke, the disorder of her laughter in the darkroom distracted his attention and made him bump into things.<br />

On a certain occasion Aureliano was there working on his silver, and Pilar Ternera leaned over the table to admire his laborious patience. Suddenly it happened. Aureliano made sure that Arcadio was in the darkroom before raising his eyes and meeting those Pilar Ternera, whose thought was perfectly visible, as if exposed to the light of noon.<br />

"Well," Aureliano said. "Tell me what it is."<br />

Pilar Ternera bit her lips with a sad smile.<br />

"That you'd be good in a war," she said. "Where you put your eye, you put your bullet."<br />

Aureliano relaxed with the proof of the omen. He went back to concentrate on his work as if nothing had happened, and his voice took on a restful strength.<br />

"I will recognize him," he said. "He'll bear my name."<br />

José Arcadio Buendía finally got what he was looking for: he connected the mechanism of the clock to a mechanical ballerina, and the toy danced uninterruptedly to the rhythm of her own music for three days. That discovery excited him much more than any of his other harebrained undertakings. He stopped eating. He stopped sleeping. Only the vigilance and care of Rebeca kept him from being dragged off by his imagination into a state of perpetual delirium from which he would not recover.<br />

He would spend the nights walking around the room thinking aloud, searching for a way to apply the principles of the pendulum to oxcarts, to harrows, to everything that was useful when put into motion. The fever of insomnia fatigued him so much that one dawn he could not recognize the old man with white hair and uncertain gestures who came into his bedroom. It was Prudencio Aguilar. When he finally identified him, startled that the dead also aged, José Arcadio Buendía felt himself shaken by nostalgia.<br />

"Prudencio," he exclaimed. "You've come from a long way off!" After many years of death the yearning for the living was so intense, the need for company so pressing, so terrifying the neatness that other death which exists within death, that Prudencio Aguilar had ended up loving his worst enemy. He had spent a great deal of time looking for him. He asked the dead from Riohacha about him, the dead who came from the Upar Valley, those who came from the swamp, and no one could tell him because Macondo was a town that was unknown to the dead until Melquíades arrived and marked it with a small black dot on the motley maps of death.<br />

José Arcadio Buendía conversed with Prudencio Aguilar until dawn. A few hours later, worn out by the vigil, he went into Aureliano's workshop and asked him: "What day is today?" Aureliano told him that it was Tuesday. "I was thinking the same thing," José Arcadio Buendía said, "but suddenly I realized that it's still Monday, like yesterday. Look at the sky, look at the walls, look at the begonias. Today is Monday too." Used to his manias, Aureliano paid no attention to him.<br />

On the next day, Wednesday, José Arcadio Buendía went back to the workshop. "This is a disaster," he said. "Look at the air, listen to the buzzing of the sun, the same as yesterday and the day before. Today is Monday too." That night Pietro Crespi found him on the porch, weeping for Prudencio Aguilar, for Melquíades, for Rebeca's parents, for his mother and father, for all of those he could remember and who were now alone in death. He gave him a mechanical bear that walked on its hind legs on a tightrope, but he could not distract him from his obsession.<br />

He asked him what had happened to the project he had explained to him a few days before about the possibility of building a pendulum machine that would help men to fly and he answered that it was impossible because a pendulum could lift anything into the air but it could not lift itself. On Thursday he appeared in the workshop again with the painful look of plowed ground. "The time machine has broken," he almost sobbed, "Úrsula and Amaranta so far away!"<br />

Aureliano scolded him like a child he adopted a contrite air. He spent six hours examining things, trying to find a difference from their appearance on the previous day in the hope of discovering in them some change that would reveal the passage of time. He spent the whole night in bed with his eyes open, calling to Prudencio Aguilar, to Melquíades, to all the dead, so that they would share his distress. But no one came.<br />

On Friday. before anyone arose, he watched the appearance of nature again until he did not have the slightest doubt but that it was Monday. Then he grabbed the bar from a door and with the savage violence his uncommon strength he smashed to dust the equipment in the alchemy laboratory, the daguerreotype room, the silver workshop, shouting like a man possessed in some high-sounding and fluent but completely incomprehensible language. He was about to finish off the rest of the house when Aureliano asked the neighbors for help. Ten men were needed to get him down, fourteen to tie him up, twenty to drag him to the chestnut tree in the courtyard, where they left him tied up, barking in the strange language and giving off a green froth at the mouth.<br />

When Úrsula and Amaranta returned he was still tied to the trunk of the chestnut tree by his hands feet, soaked with rain and in a state of total innocence. They spoke to him and he looked at them without recognizing them, saying things they did not understand. Úrsula untied his wrists and ankles, lacerated by the pressure of the rope, and left him tied only by the waist. Later on they built him a shelter of palm brandies to protect him from the sun and the rain.<br />
