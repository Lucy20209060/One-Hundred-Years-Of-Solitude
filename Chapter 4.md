The new house, white, like a dove, was inaugurated with a dance. Úrsula had got that idea from the afternoon when she saw Rebeca and Amaranta changed into adolescents, and it could almost have been said that the main reason behind the construction was a desire to have a proper place for the girls to receive visitors.<br />新居粉饰得白如雪鸽，在舞蹈中举行了落成仪式。苏尔苏拉是在那个下午看到丽贝卡和阿玛兰塔已长成亭亭玉立的少女，才萌生了这个主意，几乎可以说，建造新居的主要原因是希望女儿们能有个合适的地方接待宾客。

In order that nothing would be lacking in splendor she worked like a galley slave as the repairs were under way, so that before they were finished she had ordered costly necessities for the decorations, the table service, and the marvelous invention that was to arouse the astonishment of the town and the jubilation of the young people: the pianola.<br />为确保十全十美，在修建过程中她像奴隶苦役一样辛勤地工作。完工之前，她订购了昂贵的必需装饰品、餐桌服务以及足以令全镇惊愕和年轻人为之欢呼的奇妙发明：皮阿诺拉自动钢琴。

They delivered it broken down, packed in several boxes that were unloaded along with the Viennese furniture, the Bohemian crystal, the table service from the Indies Company, the tablecloths from Holland, and a rich variety of lamps and candlesticks, hangings and drapes. The import house sent along at its own expense an Italian expert, Pietro Crespi, to assemble and tune the pianola, to instruct the purchasers in its functioning, and to teach them how to dance the latest music printed on its six paper rolls.<br />他们将其分解递送，装在多个箱子里，一同卸载下来的还有维也纳家具，波西米亚水晶制品，印度公司的餐桌服务，荷兰的桌布和各式各样的灯、烛台、帷幔、帷帘。进口公司自费派遣了一个意大利专家——皮埃特罗·克雷斯皮，负责组装调试钢琴，指导买家如何使用，并教授如何伴着六卷纸带上的新潮音乐跳舞。

Pietro Crespi was young and blond, the most handsome and well mannered man who had ever been seen in Macondo, so scrupulous in his dress that in spite of the suffocating heat he would work in his brocade vest and heavy coat of dark cloth. Soaked in sweat, keeping a reverent distance from the owners of the house, he spent several weeks shut up is the parlor with a dedication much like that of Aureliano in his silverwork.<br />皮埃特罗·克雷斯皮是个金发碧眼的年轻人，也是在马孔多见过最英俊又彬彬有礼的男人。他非常注重仪表，尽管天气窒息般燥热，他工作时仍然穿着锦缎背心和厚厚的深色呢子上衣，满头大汗，与房主保持着恭敬的距离，好几周把自己关在客厅，无私奉献地工作，就像奥雷里亚诺对待他的银制工艺品。

One morning, without opening the door, without calling anyone to witness the miracle, he placed the first roll in the pianola and the tormenting hammering and the constant noise of wooden lathings ceased in a silence that was started at the order and neatness of the music. They all ran to the parlor.<br />一天早上，没有开门，也没有召集人见证此刻奇迹，他在自动钢琴上装好第一卷纸带，恼人的捶打声和木板条持续的噪声戛然而止，纯净有序的音乐响起，人们都纷纷跑来客厅。

José Arcadio Buendía was as if struck by lightning, not because of the beauty of the melody, but because of the automatic working of the keys of the pianola, and he set up Melquíades' camera with the hope of getting a daguerreotype of the invisible player.<br />何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚好似被闪电击中，不是因为旋律之优美，而是因为琴键在自动弹奏。他架起梅尔基亚德斯的照相机，希望拍到这位隐形演奏者的照片。

That day the Italian had lunch with them. Rebeca and Amaranta, serving the table, were intimidated by the way in which the angelic man with pale and ringless hands manipulated the utensils. In the living room, next to the parlor, Pietro Crespi taught them how to dance. He showed them the steps without touching them, keeping time with a metronome, under the friendly eye of Úrsula, who did not leave the room for a moment while her daughters had their lesson.<br />那天这位意大利人与他们共进午餐。在餐桌旁服务的丽贝卡和阿玛兰塔惊诧于这个天使般的男人苍白尚未戴戒指的苍白双手操作刀叉的方式。在客厅旁边的起居室，皮埃特罗·克雷斯皮教她们跳舞。跟随着节拍器，在身体不触碰到她们的情况下向她们展示舞步。乌尔苏拉友好地监视着，女儿上课期间，她未曾一刻离开过房间。

Pietro Crespi wore special pants on those days, very elastic and tight, and dancing slippers, "You don't have to worry so much," José Arcadio Buendía told her. "The man's a fairy." But she did not leave off her vigilance until the apprenticeship was over and the Italian left Macondo. Then they began to organize the party.<br />皮埃特罗·克雷斯皮

Úrsula drew up a strict guest list, in which the only ones invited were the descendants of the founders, except for the family of Pilar Ternera, who by then had had two more children by unknown fathers. It was truly a highclass list, except that it was determined by feelings of friendship, for those favored were not only the oldest friends of José Arcadio Buendía's house since before they undertook the exodus and the founding of Macondo, but also their sons and grandsons, who were the constant companions of Aureliano and Arcadio since infancy, and their daughters, who were the only ones who visited the house to embroider with Rebeca and Amaranta.<br />

Don Apolinar Moscote, the benevolent ruler whose activity had been reduced to the maintenance from his scanty resources of two policemen armed with wooden clubs, was a figurehead. In older to support the household expenses his daughters had opened a sewing shop, where they made felt flowers as well as guava delicacies, and wrote love notes to order. But in spite of being modest and hard-working, the most beautiful girls in Iowa, and the most skilled at the new dances, they did not manage to be considered for the party.<br />
