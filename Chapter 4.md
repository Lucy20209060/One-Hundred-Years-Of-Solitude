The new house, white, like a dove, was inaugurated with a dance. Úrsula had got that idea from the afternoon when she saw Rebeca and Amaranta changed into adolescents, and it could almost have been said that the main reason behind the construction was a desire to have a proper place for the girls to receive visitors.<br />新居粉饰得白如雪鸽，在舞蹈中举行了落成仪式。苏尔苏拉是在那个下午看到丽贝卡和阿玛兰塔已长成亭亭玉立的少女，才萌生了这个主意，几乎可以说，建造新居的主要原因是希望女儿们能有个合适的地方接待宾客。

In order that nothing would be lacking in splendor she worked like a galley slave as the repairs were under way, so that before they were finished she had ordered costly necessities for the decorations, the table service, and the marvelous invention that was to arouse the astonishment of the town and the jubilation of the young people: the pianola.<br />为确保十全十美，在修建过程中她像奴隶苦役一样辛勤地工作。完工之前，她订购了昂贵的必需装饰品、餐桌服务以及足以令全镇惊愕和年轻人为之欢呼的奇妙发明：皮阿诺拉自动钢琴。

They delivered it broken down, packed in several boxes that were unloaded along with the Viennese furniture, the Bohemian crystal, the table service from the Indies Company, the tablecloths from Holland, and a rich variety of lamps and candlesticks, hangings and drapes. The import house sent along at its own expense an Italian expert, Pietro Crespi, to assemble and tune the pianola, to instruct the purchasers in its functioning, and to teach them how to dance the latest music printed on its six paper rolls.<br />他们将其分解递送，装在多个箱子里，一同卸载下来的还有维也纳家具，波西米亚水晶制品，印度公司的餐桌服务，荷兰的桌布和各式各样的灯、烛台、帷幔、帷帘。进口公司自费派遣了一个意大利专家——皮埃特罗·克雷斯皮，负责组装调试钢琴，指导买家如何使用，并教授如何伴着六卷纸带上的新潮音乐跳舞。

Pietro Crespi was young and blond, the most handsome and well mannered man who had ever been seen in Macondo, so scrupulous in his dress that in spite of the suffocating heat he would work in his brocade vest and heavy coat of dark cloth. Soaked in sweat, keeping a reverent distance from the owners of the house, he spent several weeks shut up is the parlor with a dedication much like that of Aureliano in his silverwork.<br />皮埃特罗·克雷斯皮是个金发碧眼的年轻人，也是在马孔多见过最英俊又彬彬有礼的男人。他非常注重仪表，尽管天气窒息般燥热，他工作时仍然穿着锦缎背心和厚厚的深色呢子上衣，满头大汗，与房主保持着恭敬的距离，好几周把自己关在客厅，无私奉献地工作，就像奥雷里亚诺对待他的银制工艺品。

One morning, without opening the door, without calling anyone to witness the miracle, he placed the first roll in the pianola and the tormenting hammering and the constant noise of wooden lathings ceased in a silence that was startled at the order and neatness of the music. They all ran to the parlor.<br />一天早上，没有开门，也没有召集人见证此刻奇迹，他在自动钢琴上装好第一卷纸带，恼人的捶打声和木板条持续的噪声戛然而止，纯净有序的音乐响起，人们都纷纷跑来客厅。

José Arcadio Buendía was as if struck by lightning, not because of the beauty of the melody, but because of the automatic working of the keys of the pianola, and he set up Melquíades' camera with the hope of getting a daguerreotype of the invisible player.<br />何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚好似被闪电击中，不是因为旋律之优美，而是因为琴键在自动弹奏。他架起梅尔基亚德斯的照相机，希望拍到这位隐形演奏者的照片。

That day the Italian had lunch with them. Rebeca and Amaranta, serving the table, were intimidated by the way in which the angelic man with pale and ringless hands manipulated the utensils. In the living room, next to the parlor, Pietro Crespi taught them how to dance. He showed them the steps without touching them, keeping time with a metronome, under the friendly eye of Úrsula, who did not leave the room for a moment while her daughters had their lesson.<br />那天这位意大利人与他们共进午餐。在餐桌旁服务的丽贝卡和阿玛兰塔惊诧于这个天使般的男人苍白尚未戴戒指的苍白双手操作刀叉的方式。在客厅旁边的起居室，皮埃特罗·克雷斯皮教她们跳舞。跟随着节拍器，在身体不触碰到她们的情况下向她们展示舞步。乌尔苏拉友好地监视着，女儿上课期间，她未曾一刻离开过房间。

Pietro Crespi wore special pants on those days, very elastic and tight, and dancing slippers, "You don't have to worry so much," José Arcadio Buendía told her. "The man's a fairy." But she did not leave off her vigilance until the apprenticeship was over and the Italian left Macondo.<br />皮埃特罗·克雷斯皮那时穿着舞鞋和特殊的裤子，非常的紧身有弹性。何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚告诉乌尔苏拉，“这人是个同性恋。”但她没有放松警惕，直到学徒期结束，意大利人离开了马孔多。

Then they began to organize the party. Úrsula drew up a strict guest list, in which the only ones invited were the descendants of the founders, except for the family of Pilar Ternera, who by then had had two more children by unknown fathers.<br />接着他们开始组织聚会。乌尔苏拉制定了一份严格的来宾名单，受邀的只有马孔多创建者的后代，除了皮拉尔·特尔内拉一家，这个女人又生个两个父亲不明的孩子。

It was truly a highclass list, except that it was determined by feelings of friendship, for those favored were not only the oldest friends of José Arcadio Buendía's house since before they undertook the exodus and the founding of Macondo, but also their sons and grandsons, who were the constant companions of Aureliano and Arcadio since infancy, and their daughters, who were the only ones who visited the house to embroider with Rebeca and Amaranta.<br />这是一份真正的高等级名单，只不过是通过友情来决定的，因为受邀者不仅在背井离乡到此建立马孔多之前就已经是何塞·阿尔卡蒂奥·布恩迪亚家的老朋友了，而且他们的儿孙们跟奥雷里亚诺和阿尔卡蒂奥从小就是伙伴，他们的女儿也是唯一可以来她家与丽贝卡和阿玛兰塔一同绣花的。

Don Apolinar Moscote, the benevolent ruler whose activity had been reduced to the maintenance from his scanty resources of two policemen armed with wooden clubs, was a figurehead. In older to support the household expenses his daughters had opened a sewing shop, where they made felt flowers as well as guava delicacies, and wrote love notes to order. But in spite of being modest and hard-working, the most beautiful girls in Iowa, and the most skilled at the new dances, they did not manage to be considered for the party.<br />仁慈的地方官堂·阿波利纳尔·摩斯柯特的职责被削减到仅限于用微薄的经费供养两名用木棒武装的警察，不过是有名无实。为了养家糊口，他的女儿们开了一家缝纫店，她们制作毡花和番石榴食品，以及代人写情书。但是尽管她们谦逊勤劳，是镇上最漂亮的姑娘，新式舞蹈也非常的熟练，却根本没有考虑受邀参加聚会。

While úrsula and the girls unpacked furniture, polished silverware, and hung pictures of maidens in boats full of roses, which gave a breath of new life to the naked areas that the masons had built, José Arcadio Buendía stopped his pursuit of the image of God, convinced of His nonexistence, and he took the pianola apart in order to decipher its magical secret.

Two days before the party, swamped in a shower of leftover keys and hammers, bungling in the midst of a mixup of strings that would unroll in one direction and roll up again in the other, he succeeded in a fashion in putting the instrument back together. There had never been as many surprises and as much dashing about as in those days, but the new pitch lamps were lighted on the designated day and hour.

The house was opened, still smelling of resin and damp whitewash, and the children and grandchildren of the founders saw the porch with ferns and begonias, the quiet rooms, the garden saturated with the fragrance of the roses, and they gathered together in the parlor, facing the unknown invention that had been covered with a white sheet.

Those who were familiar with the piano, popular in other towns in the swamp, felt a little disheartened, but more bitter was úrsula's disappointment when she put in the first roll so that Amaranta and Rebeca could begin the dancing and the mechanism did not work. Melquíades, almost blind by then, crumbling with decrepitude, used the arts of his timeless wisdom in an attempt to fix it. Finally José Arcadio Buendía managed, by mistake, to move a device that was stuck and the music came out, first in a burst and then in a flow of mixed-up notes.

Beating against the strings that had been put in without order or concert and had been tuned with temerity, the hammers let go. But the stubborn descendants of the twenty-one intrepid people who plowed through the mountains in search of the sea to the west avoided the reefs of the melodic mix-up and the dancing went on until dawn.
